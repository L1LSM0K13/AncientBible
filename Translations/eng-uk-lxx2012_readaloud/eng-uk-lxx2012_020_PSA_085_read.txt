Chapter 85.
(86) A Prayer of David. O Lord, incline your ear, and listen to me; for I am poor and needy. 
Preserve my soul, for I am holy; save your servant, O God, who hopes in you. 
Pity me, O Lord: for to you will I cry all the day. 
Rejoice the sold of your servant: for to you, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul. 
For you, O Lord, are kind, and gentle; and plenteous in mercy to all that call upon you. 
Give ear to my prayer, o Lord; and attend to the voice of my supplication. 
In the day of my trouble I cried to you: for you did hear me. 
There is none like to you, O Lord, amongst the god; and there are no works like to your works. 
All nations whom you have made shall come, and shall worship before you, O Lord; and shall glorify your name. 
For you are great, and do wonders: you are the only and the great God. 
Guide me, O Lord, in your way, and I will walk in your truth: let my heart rejoice, that I may fear your name. 
I will give you thanks, O Lord my God, with all my heart; and I will glorify your name for ever. 
For your mercy is great towards me; and you have delivered my soul from the lowest hell. 
O God, transgressors have risen up against me, and an assembly of violent men have sought my life; and have not set you before them. 
But you, O Lord God, are compassionate and merciful, longsuffering, and abundant in mercy and true. 
Look you upon me, and have mercy upon me: give your strength to your servant, and save the son of your handmaid. 
Establish with me a token for good; and let them that hate me see it and be ashamed; because you, O Lord, have helped me, and comforted me.
