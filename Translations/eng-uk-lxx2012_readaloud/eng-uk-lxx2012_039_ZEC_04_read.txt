Zacharias.
Chapter 4.
And the angel that talked with me returned, and awakened me, as when a man is awakened out of his sleep. 
And he said to me, What see you? And I said, I have seen, and behold a candlestick all of gold, and its bowl upon it, and seven lamps upon it, and seven oil funnels to the lamps upon it: 
and two olive-trees above it, one on the right of the bowl, and one on the left. 
And I enquired, and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these things, my lord? 
And the angel that talked with me answered, and spoke to me, saying, Know you not what these things are? And I said, No, my lord. 
And he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the Lord to Zorobabel, saying, Not by mighty power, nor by strength, but by my Spirit, says the Lord Almighty. 
Who are you, the great mountain before Zorobabel, that you should prosper? whereas I will bring out the stone of the inheritance, the grace of it the equal of my  grace. 
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 
The hands of Zorobabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall finish it: and you shall know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you. 
For who has despised the small days? surely they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet of tin in the hand of Zorobabel: these are the seven eyes that look upon all the earth. 
And I answered, and said to him, What are these two olive-trees, which are on the right and left hand of the candlestick? 
And I asked the second time, and said to him, What are the two branches of the olive-trees that are by the side of the two golden pipes that pour into and communicate with the golden oil funnels? 
And he said to me, Know you not what these are? and I said, No, my lord. 
And he said, These are the two anointed ones that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
