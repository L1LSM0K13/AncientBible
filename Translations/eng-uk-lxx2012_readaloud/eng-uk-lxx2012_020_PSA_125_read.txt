Psalms.
Chapter 125.
(126) A Song of Degrees. When the Lord turned the captivity of Sion, we became as comforted ones. 
Then was our mouth filled with joy, and our tongue with exultation: then would they say amongst the Gentiles, 
The Lord has done great things amongst them. The Lord has done great things for us, we became joyful. 
Turn, O Lord, our captivity, as the streams in the south. 
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 
They went on and wept as they cast their seeds; but they shall surely come with exultation, bringing their sheaves with them.
