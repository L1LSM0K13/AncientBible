Psalms.
Chapter 140.
(141) A Psalm of David. O Lord, I have cried to you; hear me: attend to the voice of my supplication, when I cry to you. 
Let my prayer be set forth before you as incense; the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice. 
Set a watch, O Lord, on my mouth, and a strong door about by lips. 
Incline not my heart to evil things, to employ pretexts for sins, with me who work iniquity: and I will not. let me not unite with their choice ones. 
The righteous shall chasten me with mercy, and reprove me: but let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head: for yet shall my prayer also be in their pleasures. 
Their mighty ones have been swallowed up near the rock: they shall hear my words, for they are sweet. 
As a lump of earth is crushed upon the ground, our bones have been scattered by the mouth of the grave. 
For mine eyes are to you, O Lord God: I have hoped in you; take not away my life. 
Keep me from the snare which they have set for me, and from the stumbling blocks of them that work iniquity. 
Sinners shall fall by their own net: I am alone until I shall escape.
