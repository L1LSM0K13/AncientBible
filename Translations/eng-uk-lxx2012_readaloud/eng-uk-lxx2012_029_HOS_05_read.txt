Osee.
Chapter 5.
Hear these things, you⌃ priests; and attend, O house of Israel; and listen, O house of the king; for the controversy is with you, because you⌃ have been a snare in Scopia, and as a net spread on Itabyrium, 
which they that hunt the prey have fixed: but I will correct you. 
I know Ephraim, and Israel is not far from me: for now Ephraim has gone grievously a-whoring, Israel is defiled. 
They have not framed their counsels to return to their God, for the spirit of fornication is in them, and they have not known the Lord. 
And the pride of Israel shall be brought low before his face; and Israel and Ephraim shall fall in their iniquities; and Judas also shall fall with them. 
They shall go with sheep and calves diligently to seek the Lord; but they shall not find him, for he has withdrawn himself from them. 
For they have forsaken the Lord; for strange children have been born to them: now shall the cankerworm devour them and their heritages. 
Blow you⌃ the trumpet on the hills, sound aloud on the heights: proclaim in the house of On, Benjamin is amazed. 
Ephraim has come to nothing in the days of reproof: in the tribes of Israel I have shown faithful dealings. 
The princes of Juda became as they that removed the bounds: I will pour out upon them my fury as water. 
Ephraim altogether prevailed against his adversary, he trod judgement under foot, for he began to go after vanities. 
Therefore I will be as consternation to Ephraim, and as a goad to the house of Juda. 
And Ephraim saw his disease, and Judas his pain; then Ephraim went to the Assyrians, and sent ambassadors to king Jarim: but he could not heal you, and your pain shall in nowise cease from you. 
Therefore I am as a panther to Ephraim, and as a lion to the house of Juda: and I will tear, and go away; and I will take, and there shall be none to deliver. 
I will go and return to my place, until they are brought to nothing, and then shall they seek my face.
