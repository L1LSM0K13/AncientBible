Psalms.
Chapter 150.
Alleluia. Praise God in his holy places: praise him in the firmament of his power. 
Praise him on account of his mighty acts: praise him according to his abundant greatness. 
Praise him with the sound of a trumpet: praise him with lute and harp. 
Praise him with timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and the organ. 
Praise him with melodious cymbals: praise him with loud cymbals. 
Let every thing that has breath praise the Lord.
