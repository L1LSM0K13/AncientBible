Psalms.
Chapter 122.
(123) A Song of Degrees. To you who dwell in heaven have I lifted up mine eyes. 
Behold, as the eyes of servants are directed to the hands of their masters, and as the eyes of a maidservant to the hands of her mistress; so our eyes are directed to the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us. 
Have pity upon us, O Lord, have pity upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. 
Yes, our soul has been exceedingly filled with it: let the reproach be to them that are at ease, and contempt to the proud.
