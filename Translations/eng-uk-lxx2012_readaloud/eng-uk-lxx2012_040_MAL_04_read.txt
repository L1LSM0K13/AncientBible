Malachias.
Chapter 4.
For, behold, a day comes burning as an oven, and it shall consume them; and all the aliens, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that is coming shall set them on fire, says the Lord Almighty, and there shall not be left of them root or branch. 
But to you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise, and healing shall be in his wings: and you⌃ shall go forth, and bound as young calves let loose from bonds. 
And you⌃ shall trample the wicked; for they shall be ashes underneath your feet in the day which I appoint, says the Lord Almighty. 
And, behold, I will send to you Elias the Thesbite, before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes; 
who shall turn again the heart of the father to the son, and the heart of a man to his neighbour, lest I come and strike the earth grievously. 
Remember the law of my servant Moses, accordingly as I charged him with it in Choreb for all Israel, even the commandments and ordinances.
