Sirach.
Chapter 5.
Set your heart upon your goods; and say not, I have enough for my life. 
Follow not your own mind and your strength, to walk in the ways of your heart: 
And say not, Who shall control me for my works? for the Lord will surely revenge your pride. 
Say not, I have sinned, and what harm has happened to me? for the Lord is longsuffering, he will in no wise let you go. 
Concerning propitiation, be not without fear to add sin to sin: 
And say not His mercy is great; he will be pacified for the multitude of my sins: for mercy and wrath come from him, and his indignation rests upon sinners. 
Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put not off from day to day: for suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth, and in your security you shall be destroyed, and perish in the day of vengeance. 
Set not your heart upon goods unjustly gotten, for they shall not profit you in the day of calamity. 
Winnow not with every wind, and go not into every way: for so does the sinner that has a double tongue. 
Be stedfast in your understanding; and let your word be the same. 
Be swift to hear; and let your life be sincere; and with patience give answer. 
If you have understanding, answer your neighbour; if not, lay your hand upon your mouth. 
Honour and shame is in talk: and the tongue of man is his fall. 
Be not called a whisperer, and lie not in wait with your tongue: for a foul shame is upon the thief, and an evil condemnation upon the double tongue. 
Be not ignorant of any thing in a great matter or a small.
