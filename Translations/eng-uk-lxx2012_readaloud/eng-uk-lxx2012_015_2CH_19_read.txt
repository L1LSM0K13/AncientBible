Chronicles II.
Chapter 19.
And Josaphat king of Juda returned to his house at Jerusalem. 
And there went out to meet him Jeu the prophet the son of Anani, and said to him, King Josaphat, do you help a sinner, or act friendly towards one hated of the Lord? Therefore has wrath come upon you from the Lord. 
Nevertheless some good things have been found in you, forasmuch as you did remove the groves from the land of Juda, and did direct your heart to seek after the Lord. 
And Josaphat lived in Jerusalem: and he again went out amongst the people from Bersabee to the mount of Ephraim, and turned them back to the Lord God of their fathers. 
And he appointed judges in all the strong cities of Juda, city by city. 
And he said to the judges, Take good heed what you⌃ do: for you⌃ judge not for man, but for the Lord, and with you are matters of judgement. 
And now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, and be wary, and do your duty: for there is no unrighteousness with the Lord our God, neither is it for him to respect persons, nor take bribes. 
Moreover Josaphat appointed in Jerusalem some of the priests, and Levites, and heads of houses of Israel, for the judgement of the Lord, and to judge the dwellers in Jerusalem. 
And he charged them, saying, Thus shall you⌃ do in the fear of the Lord, in truth and with a perfect heart. 
Whatsoever man of your brethren that dwell in their cities shall bring the cause that comes before you, between blood and blood, and between precept and commandment, and ordinances and judgements, you⌃ shall even decide for them; so they shall not sin against the Lord, and there shall not be wrath upon you, and upon your brethren: thus you⌃ shall do, and you⌃ shall not sin. 
And, behold, Amarias the priest is head over you in every matter of the Lord; and Zabdias the son of Ismael is head over the house of Juda in every matter of the king; and the scribes and Levites are before you: be strong and active, and the Lord shall be with the good.
