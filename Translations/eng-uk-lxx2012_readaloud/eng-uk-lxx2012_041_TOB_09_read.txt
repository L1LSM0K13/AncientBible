Tobit.
Chapter 9.
Then Tobias called Raphael, and said to him, 
Brother Azarias, take with you a servant, and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and bring me the money, and bring him to the wedding. 
For Raguel has sworn that I shall not depart. 
But my father counts the days; and if I wait long, he will be very sorry. 
So Raphael went out, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting: who brought forth bags which were sealed up, and gave them to him. 
And early in the morning they went forth both together, and came to the wedding: and Tobias blessed his wife.
