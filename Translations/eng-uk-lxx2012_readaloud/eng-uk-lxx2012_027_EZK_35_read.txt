Jezekiel.
Chapter 35.
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 
Son of man, set your face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it, 
and say to it, Thus says the Lord God; Behold, I am against you, O mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and will make you a waste, and you shall be made desolate. 
And I will cause desolation in your cities, and you shall be desolate, and you shall know that I am the Lord. 
Because you have been a perpetual enemy, and have laid wait craftily for the house of Israel, with the hand of enemies with a sword, in the time of injustice, at the last: 
Therefore, as I live, says the Lord God, verily you have sinned even to blood, therefore blood shall pursue you. 
And I will make mount Seir a waste, and desolate, and I will destroy from off it men and cattle: 
and I will fill your hills and your valleys with slain men, and in all your plains there shall fall in you men slain with the sword. 
I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities shall not be inhabited any more: and you shall know that I am the Lord. 
Because you said, The two nations and the two countries shall be mine, and I shall inherit them; whereas the Lord is there: 
therefore, as I live, says the Lord, I will even deal with you according to your enmity, and I will be made known to you when I shall judge you: 
and you shall know that I am the Lord. I have heard the voice of your blasphemies, whereas you have said, The desert mountains of Israel are given to us for food; 
and you have spoken swelling words against me with your mouth: I have heard them. 
Thus says the Lord; When all the earth is rejoicing, I will make you desert. 
You shall be desert, O mount Seir, and all Idumea; and it shall be utterly consumed: and you shall know that I am the Lord their God.
