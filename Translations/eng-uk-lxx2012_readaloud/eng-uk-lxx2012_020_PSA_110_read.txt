Psalms.
Chapter 110.
(111) Alleluia. I will give you thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart, in the council of the upright, and in the congregation. 
The works of the Lord are great, sought out according to all his will. 
His work is worthy of thanksgiving and honour: and his righteousness endures for ever and ever. 
He has caused his wonderful works to be remembered: the Lord is merciful and compassionate. 
He has given food to them that fear him: he will remember his covenant for ever. 
He has declared to his people the power of his works, to give them the inheritance of the heathen. 
The works of his hands are truth and judgement: all his commandments are sure: 
established for ever and ever, done in truth and uprightness. 
He sent redemption to his people: he commanded his covenant for ever: holy and fearful is his name. 
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and all that act accordingly have a good understanding; his praise endures for ever and ever.
