Psalms.
Chapter 23.
(24) A Psalm for David on the first day of the week. A Psalm for David on the first day of the week. The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof; the world, and all that dwell in it. 
He has founded it upon the seas, and prepared it upon the rivers. 
Who shall go up to the mountain of the Lord, and who shall stand in his holy place? 
He that is innocent in his hands and pure in his heart; who has not lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour. 
He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his Saviour. 
This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek the face of the God of Jacob. Pause. 
Lift up your gates, you⌃ princes, and be you⌃ lifted up, you⌃ everlasting doors; and the king of glory shall come in. 
Who is this king of Glory? the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. 
Lift up your gates, you⌃ princes; and be you⌃ lift up, you⌃ everlasting doors; and the king of glory shall come in. 
Who is this king of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is this king of glory.
