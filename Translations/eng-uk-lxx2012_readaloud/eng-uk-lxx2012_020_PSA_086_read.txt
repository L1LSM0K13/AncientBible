Psalms.
Chapter 86.
(87) A Psalm of a Song for the sons of Core. His foundations are in the holy mountains. 
The Lord loves the gates of Sion, more than all the tabernacles of Jacob. 
Glorious things have been spoken of you, O city of God. Pause. 
I will make mention of Raab and Babylon to them that know me: behold also the Philistines, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians: these were born there. 
A man shall say, Sion is my mother; and such a man was born in her; and the Highest himself has founded her. 
The Lord shall recount it in the writing of the people, and of these princes that were born in her. 
The dwelling of all within you is as the dwelling of those that rejoice.
