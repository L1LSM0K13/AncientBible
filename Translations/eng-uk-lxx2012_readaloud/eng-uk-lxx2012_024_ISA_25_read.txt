Esias.
Chapter 25.
O Lord God, I will glorify you, I will sing to your name; for you have done wonderful things, even an ancient and faithful counsel. So be it. 
For you have made cities a heap, even cities made strong that their foundations should not fall: the city of ungodly men shall not be built for ever. 
Therefore shall the poor people bless you, and cities of injured men shall bless you. 
For you have been a helper to every lowly city, and a shelter to them that were disheartened by reason of poverty: you shall deliver them from wicked men: you have been a shelter of them that thirst, and a refreshing air to injured men. 
We were as faint-hearted men thirsting in Sion, by reason of ungodly men to whom you did deliver us. 
And the Lord of hosts shall make a feast for all the nations: on this mount they shall drink gladness, they shall drink wine: 
they shall anoint themselves with ointment in this mountain. Impart you all these things to the nations; for this is God's counsel upon all the nations. 
Death has prevailed and swallowed men up; but again the Lord God has taken away every tear from every face. He has taken away the reproach of his people from all the earth: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it. 
And in that day they shall say, behold our God in whom we have trusted, and he shall save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, and we have exulted, and will rejoice in our salvation. 
God will give rest on this mountain, and the country of Moab shall be trodden down, as they tread the floor with waggons. 
And he shall spread forth his hands, even as he also brings down man to destroy him: and he shall bring low his pride in regard to the thing on which he has laid his hands. 
And he shall bring down the height of the refuge of the wall, and it shall come down even to the ground.
