Psalms.
Chapter 14.
(15) A Psalm of David. O Lord, who shall sojourn in your tabernacle? and who shall dwell in your holy mountain? 
He that walks blameless, and works righteousness, who speaks truth in his heart. 
Who has not spoken craftily with is tongue, neither has done evil to his neighbour, nor taken up a reproach against them that lived nearest to him. 
In his sight an evil-worker is set at nothing, but he honours them that fear the Lord. He swears to his neighbour, and disappoints him not. 
He has not lent his money on usury, and has not received bribes against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved.
