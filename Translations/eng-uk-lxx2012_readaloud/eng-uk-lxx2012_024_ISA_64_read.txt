Esias.
Chapter 64.
If you would open the heaven, trembling will take hold upon the mountains from you, and they shall melt, 
as wax melts before the fire; and fire shall burn up the enemies, and your name shall be manifest amongst the adversaries: at your presence the nations shall be troubled, 
whenever you shall work gloriously; trembling from you shall take hold upon the mountains. 
From of old we have not heard, neither have our eyes seen a God beside you, and your works which you will perform to them that wait for mercy. 
For these blessings shall happen to them that work righteousness, and they shall remember your ways: behold, you were angry and we have sinned; therefore we have erred, 
and we are all become as unclean, and all our righteousness as a filthy rag: and we have fallen as leaves because of our iniquities; thus the wind shall carry us away. 
And there is none that calls upon your name, or that remembers to take hold on you: for you have turned your face away from us, and have delivered us up because of our sins. 
And now, O Lord, you are our Father, and we are clay, all of us the work of your hands. 
Be not very angry with us, and remember not our sins for ever; but now look on us, for we are all your people. 
The city of your holiness has become desolate, Sion has become as a wilderness, Jerusalem a curse. 
The house, our sanctuary, and the glory which our fathers blessed, has been burnt with fire: and all our glorious things have gone to ruin. 
And for all these things you, O Lord, has withholden, yourself, and been silent, and have brought us very low.
