Psalms.
Chapter 58.
(59) For the end. Destroy not: by David for a memorial, when Saul sent, and watched his house to kill him. Deliver me from mine enemies, O God; and ransom me from those that rise up against me. 
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men. 
For, behold, they have hunted after my soul; violent men have set upon me: neither is it my iniquity, nor my sin, O Lord. 
Without iniquity I ran and directed my course aright: awake to help me, and behold. 
And you, Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, draw near to visit all the heathen; pity not any that work iniquity. Pause. 
They shall return at evening, and hunger like a dog, and go round about the city. 
Behold, they shall utter a voice with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips; for who, say they, has heard? 
But you, Lord, will laugh them to scorn; you will utterly set at nothing all the heathen. 
will keep my strength, looking to you; for you, O God, are my helper. 
As for my God, his mercy shall go before me: my God will show me vengeance on mine enemies. 
Slay them not, lest they forget your law; scatter them by your power; and bring them down, O Lord, my defender. 
For the sin of their mouth, and the word of their lips, let them be even taken in their pride. 
And for their cursing and falsehood shall utter destruction be denounced: they shall fall by the wrath of utter destruction, and shall not be; so shall they know that the God of Jacob is Lord of the ends of the earth. Pause. 
They shall return at evening, and be hungry as a dog, and go round about the city. 
They shall be scattered hither and there for meat; and if they be not satisfied, they shall even murmur. 
But I will sing to your strength, and in the morning will I exult in your mercy; for you have been my supporter, and my refuge in the day of mine affliction. 
You are my helper; to you, my God, will I sing; you are my supporter, O my God, and my mercy.
