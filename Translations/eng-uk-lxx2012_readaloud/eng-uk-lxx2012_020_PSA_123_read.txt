Psalms.
Chapter 123.
(124) A Song of Degrees. If it had not been that the Lord was amongst us, let Israel now say; 
if it had not been that the Lord was amongst us, when men rose up against us; 
verily they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us: 
verily the water would have drowned us, our soul would have gone under the torrent. 
Yes, our soul would have gone under the overwhelming water. 
Blessed be the Lord, who has not given us for a prey to their teeth. 
Our soul has been delivered as a sparrow from the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are delivered. 
Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
