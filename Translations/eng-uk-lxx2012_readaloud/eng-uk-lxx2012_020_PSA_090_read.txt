Psalms.
Chapter 90.
(91) Praise of a Song, by David. He that dwells in the help of the Highest, shall sojourn under the shelter of the God of heaven. 
He shall say to the Lord, You are my helper and my refuge: my God; I will hope in him. 
For he shall deliver you from the snare of the hunters, from every troublesome matter. 
He shall overshadow you with his shoulders, and you shall trust under his wings: his truth shall cover you with a shield. 
You shall not be afraid of terror by night; nor of the arrow flying by day; 
nor of the evil thing that walks in darkness; nor of calamity, and the evil spirit at noon-day. 
A thousand shall fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come near you. 
Only with your eyes shall you observe and see the reward of sinners. 
For you, O Lord, are my hope: you, my soul, have made the Most High your refuge. 
No evils shall come upon you, and no scourge shall draw near to your dwelling. 
For he shall give his angels charge concerning you, to keep you in all your ways. 
They shall bear you up on their hands, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone. 
You shall tread on the asp and basilisk: and you shall trample on the lion and dragon. 
For he has hoped in me, and I will deliver him: I will protect him, because he has known my name. 
He shall call upon me, and I will listen to him: I am with him in affliction; and I will deliver him, and glorify him. 
I will satisfy him with length of days, and show him my salvation.
