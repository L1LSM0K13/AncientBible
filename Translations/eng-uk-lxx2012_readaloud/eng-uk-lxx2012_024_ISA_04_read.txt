Esias.
Chapter 4.
And seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own raiment: only let your name be called upon us, and take away our reproach. 
And in that day God shall shine gloriously in counsel on the earth, to exalt and glorify the remnant of Israel. 
And it shall be, that the remnant left in Sion, and the remnant left in Jerusalem, even all that are appointed to life in Jerusalem, shall be called holy. 
For the Lord shall wash away the filth of the sons and daughters of Sion, and shall purge out the blood from the midst of them, with the spirit of judgement, and the spirit of burning. 
And he shall come, and it shall be with regard to every place of mount Sion, yes, all the region round about it shall a cloud overshadow by day, and there shall be as it were the smoke and light of fire burning by night: and upon all the glory shall be a defence. 
And it shall be for a shadow from the heat, and as a shelter and a hiding place from inclemency of weather and from rain.
