Psalms.
Chapter 42.
(43) A Psalm of David. Judge me, O God, and plead my cause, against an ungodly nation: deliver me from the unjust and crafty man. 
For you, O God, are my strength: therefore have you cast me off? and why do I go sad of countenance, while the enemy oppresses me? 
Send forth your light and your truth: they have led me, and brought me to your holy mountain, and to your tabernacles. 
And I will go in to the altar of God, to God who gladdens my youth: I will give thanks to you on the harp, O God, my God. 
Therefore are you very sad, O my soul? and therefore do you trouble me? Hope in God; for I will give thanks to him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.
