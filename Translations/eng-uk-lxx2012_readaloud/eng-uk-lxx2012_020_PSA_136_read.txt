Psalms.
Chapter 136.
(137) For David, a Psalm of Jeremias. By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat; and wept when we remembered Sion. 
We hung our harps on the willows in the midst of it. 
For there they that had taken us captive asked of us the words of a song; and they that had carried us away asked a hymn, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Sion. 
How should we sing the Lord's song in a strange land? 
If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill. 
May my tongue cleave to my throat, if I do not remember you; if I do not prefer Jerusalem as the chief of my joy. 
Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to its foundations. 
Wretched daughter of Babylon! blessed shall he be who shall reward you as you have rewarded us. 
Blessed shall he be who shall seize and dash your infants against the rock.
