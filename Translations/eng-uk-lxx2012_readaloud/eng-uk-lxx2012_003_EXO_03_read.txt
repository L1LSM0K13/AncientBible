Exodus.
Chapter 3.
And Moses was feeding the flock of Jothor his father-in-law, the priest of Madiam; and he brought the sheep near to the wilderness, and came to the mount of Choreb. 
And an angel of the Lord appeared to him in flaming fire out of the bush, and he sees that the bush burns with fire, —but the bush was not consumed. 
And Moses said, I will go near and see this great sight, why the bush is not consumed. 
And when the Lord saw that he drew near to see, the Lord called him out of the bush, saying, Moses, Moses; and he said, What is it? 
And he said, Draw not near hither: loose your sandals from off your feet, for the place whereon you stand is holy ground. 
And he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraam, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and Moses turned away his face, for he was afraid to gaze at God. 
And the Lord said to Moses, I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and I have heard their cry caused by their taskmasters; for I know their affliction. 
And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land, and to bring them into a good and wide land, into a land flowing with milk and honey, into the place of the Chananites, and the Chettites, and Amorites, and Pherezites, and Gergesites, and Evites, and Jebusites. 
And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come to me, and I have seen the affliction with which the Egyptians afflict them. 
And now come, I will send you to Pharao king of Egypt, and you shall bring out my people the children of Israel from the land of Egypt. 
And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharao king of Egypt, and that I should bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt? 
And God spoke to Moses, saying, I will be with you, and this shall be the sign to you that I shall send you forth, —when you bring out my people out of Egypt, then you⌃ shall serve God in this mountain. 
And Moses said to God, Behold, I shall go forth to the children of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of our fathers has sent me to you; and they will ask me, What is his name? What shall I say to them? 
And God spoke to Moses, saying, I am THE BEING; and he said, Thus shall you⌃ say to the children of Israel, THE BEING has sent me to you. 
And God said again to Moses, Thus shall you say to the sons of Israel, The Lord God of our fathers, the God of Abraam, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, has sent me to you: this is my name for ever, and my memorial to generations of generations. 
Go then and gather the elders of the children of Israel, and you shall say to them, The Lord God of our fathers has appeared to me, the God of Abraam, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, saying, I have surely looked upon you, and upon all the things which have happened to you in Egypt. 
And he said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of the Egyptians to the land of the Chananites and the Chettites, and Amorites and Pherezites, and Gergesites, and Evites, and Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey. 
And they shall listen to your voice, and you and the elders of Israel shall go in to Pharao king of Egypt, and you shall say to him, The God of the Hebrews has called us; we will go then a journey of three days into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to our God. 
But I know that Pharao king of Egypt will not let you go, save with a mighty hand; 
and I will stretch out my hand, and strike the Egyptians with all my wonders, which I shall work amongst them, and after that he will send you forth. 
And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, and whenever you⌃ shall escape, you⌃ shall not depart empty. 
But every woman shall ask of her neighbour and fellow lodger, articles of gold and silver, and apparel; and you⌃ shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters, —and spoil you⌃ the Egyptians.
