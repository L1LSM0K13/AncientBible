Esias.
Chapter 56.
Thus says the Lord, Keep you⌃ judgement, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my mercy to be revealed. 
Blessed is the man that does these things, and the man that holds by them, and keeps the sabbaths from profaning them, and keeps his hands from doing unrighteousness. 
Let not the stranger who attaches himself to the Lord, say, Surely the Lord will separate me from his people: and let not the eunuch say, I am a dry tree. 
Thus says the Lord to the eunuchs, as many as shall keep my sabbaths, and choose the things which I take pleasure in, and take hold of my covenant; 
I will give to them in my house and within my walls an honourable place, better than sons and daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, and it shall not fail. 
And I will give it to the strangers that attach themselves to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be to him servants and handmaids; and as for all that keep my sabbaths from profaning them, and that take hold of my covenant; 
I will bring them to my holy mountain, and gladden them in my house of prayer: their whole burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon mine altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations, 
says the Lord that gathers the dispersed of Israel; for I will gather to him a congregation. 
All you⌃ beasts of the field, come, devour, all you⌃ beasts of the forest. 
See how they are all blinded: they have not known; they are dumb dogs that will not bark; dreaming of rest, loving to slumber. 
Yes, they are insatiable dogs, that know not what it is to be filled, and they are wicked, having no understanding: all have followed their own ways, each according to his will.
