Esias.
Chapter 39.
At that time Marodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, the king of Babylonia, sent letters and ambassadors and gifts to Ezekias: for he had heard that he had been sick even to death, and was recovered. 
And Ezekias was glad of their coming, and he showed them the house of his spices, and of silver, and gold, and myrrh, and incense, and ointment, and all the houses of his treasures, and all that he had in his stores: and there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, which Ezekias did not show. 
And Esaias the prophet came to king Ezekias, and said to him, What say these men? and whence came they to you? and Ezekias said, They are come to me from a land afar off, from Babylon. 
And Esaias said, What have they seen in your house? and Ezekias said, They have seen everything in my house; and there is nothing in my house which they have not seen: yes, also the possessions in my treasuries. 
And Esaias said to him, Hear the word of the Lord of hosts: 
Behold, the days come, when they shall take all the things that are in your house, and all that your fathers have gathered until this day, shall go to Babylon; and they shall not leave anything at all: and God has said, 
that they shall take also of your children whom you shall beget; and they shall make them eunuchs in the house of the king of the Babylonians. 
And Ezekias said to Esaias, Good is the word of the Lord, which he has spoken: let there, I pray, be peace and righteousness in my days.
