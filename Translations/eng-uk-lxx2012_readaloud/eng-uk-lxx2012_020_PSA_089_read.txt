Psalms.
Chapter 89.
(90) A Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, you have been our refuge in all generations. 
Before the mountains existed, and before the earth and the world were formed, even from age to age, You are. 
Turn not man back to his low place, whereas you said, Return, you⌃ sons of men? 
For a thousand years in your sight are as the yesterday which is past, and as a watch in the night. 
Years shall be vanity to them: let the morning pass away as grass. 
In the morning let it flower, and pass away: in the evening let it droop, let it be withered and dried up. 
For we have perished in your anger, and in your wrath we have been troubled. 
You have set our transgressions before you: our age is in the light of your countenance. 
For all our days are gone, and we have passed away in your wrath: our years have spun out their tale as a spider. 
As for the days of our years, in them are seventy years; and if men should be in strength, eighty years: and the greater part of them would be labour and trouble; for weakness overtakes us, and we shall be chastened. 
Who knows the power of your wrath? 
and who knows how to number his days because of the fear of your wrath? So manifest your right hand, and those that are instructed in wisdom in the heart. 
Return, O Lord, how long? and be entreated concerning your servants. 
We have been satisfied in the morning with your mercy; and we did exult and rejoice: 
let us rejoice in all our days, in return for the days wherein you did afflict us, the years wherein we saw evil. 
And look upon your servants, and upon your works; and guide their children. 
And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us: and do you direct for us the works of our hands.
