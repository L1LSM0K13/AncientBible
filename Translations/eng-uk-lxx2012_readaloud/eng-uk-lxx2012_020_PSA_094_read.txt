Psalms.
Chapter 94.
(95) The praise of a Song by David. Come, let us exult in the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to God our Saviour. 
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise to him with psalms. 
For the Lord is a great God, and a great king over all gods: for the Lord will not cast off his people. 
For the ends of the earth are in his hands; and the heights of the mountains are his. 
For the sea is his, and he made it: and is hands formed the dry land. 
Come, let us worship and fall down before him; and weep before the Lord that made us. 
For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. 
To-day, if you⌃ will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, according to the day of irritation in the wilderness: 
where your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works. 
Forty years was I grieved with this generation, and said, They do always err in their heart, and they have not known my ways. 
So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.
