Psalms.
Chapter 130.
(131) A Song of Degrees. O Lord, my heart is not exalted, neither have mine eyes been haughtily raised: neither have I exercised myself in great matters, nor in things too wonderful for me. 
I shall have sinned if I have not been humble, but have exulted my soul: according to the relation of a weaned child to his mother, so will you recompense my soul. 
Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.
