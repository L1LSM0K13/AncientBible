Psalms.
Chapter 113.
(114) Alleluia. At the going forth of Israel from Egypt, of the house of Jacob from a barbarous people, 
Judea became his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion. 
The sea saw and fled: Jordan was turned back. 
The mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like lambs. 
What ailed you, O sea, that you fled? and you Jordan, that you were turned back? 
You⌃ mountains, that you⌃ skipped like rams, and you⌃ hills, like lambs? 
The earth trembled at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; 
who turned the rock into pools of water, and the flint into fountains of water.
