Psalms.
Chapter 129.
(130) A Song of Degrees. Out of the depths have I cried to you, O Lord. 
O Lord, listen to my voice; let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication. 
If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? 
For with you is forgiveness: for your name's sake 
have I waited for you, O Lord, my soul has waited for your word. 
My soul has hoped in the Lord; from the morning watch till night. 
Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. 
And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
