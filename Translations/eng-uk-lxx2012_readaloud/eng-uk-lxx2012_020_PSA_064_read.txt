Psalms.
Chapter 64.
(65) For the end, a Psalm and Song of David. Praise becomes you, O God, in Sion; and to you shall the vow be performed. 
Hear my prayer; to you all flesh shall come. 
The words of transgressors have overpowered us; but do you pardon our sins. 
Blessed is he whom you have chosen and adopted; he shall dwell in your courts; we shall be filled with the good things of your house; your temple is holy. 
You are wonderful in righteousness. Listen to us, O God our Saviour; the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are on the sea afar off: 
who do establish the mountains in your strength, being girded about with power; 
who trouble the depth of the sea, the sounds of its waves. 
The nations shall be troubled, and they that inhabit the ends of the earth shall be afraid of your signs; you will cause the outgoings of morning and evening to rejoice. 
You have visited the earth, and saturated it; you have abundantly enriched it. The river of God is filled with water; you have prepared their food, for thus is the preparation of it. 
Saturate her furrows, multiply her fruits; the crop springing up shall rejoice in its drops. 
You will bless the crown of the year because of your goodness; and your plains shall be filled with fatness. 
The mountains of the wilderness shall be enriched; and the hills shall gird themselves with joy. 
The rams of the flock are clothed with wool, and the valleys shall abound in corn; they shall cry aloud, yes they shall sing hymns.
