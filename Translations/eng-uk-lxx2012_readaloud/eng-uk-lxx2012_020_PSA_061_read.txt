Psalms.
Chapter 61.
(62) For the end, a Psalm of David for Idithun. Shall not my soul be subjected to God? for of him is my salvation. 
For he is my God, and my saviour; my helper, I shall not be moved very much. 
How long will you⌃ assault a man? you⌃ are all slaughtering as with a bowed wall and a broken hedge. 
They only took counsel to set at nothing mine honour: I ran in thirst: with their mouth they blessed, but with their heart they cursed. Pause. 
Nevertheless do you, my soul, be subjected to God; for of him is my patient hope. 
For he is my God and my Saviour; my helper, I shall not be moved. 
In God is my salvation and my glory: he is the God of my help, and my hope is in God. 
Hope in him, all you⌃ congregation of the people; pour out your hearts before him, for God is our helper. Pause. 
But the sons of men are vain; the sons of men are false, so as to be deceitful in the balances; they are all alike formed out of vanity. 
Trust not in unrighteousness, and lust not after robberies: if wealth should flow in, set not your heart upon it. 
God has spoken once, and I have heard these two things, that power is of God; 
and mercy is your, O Lord; for you will recompense every one according to his works.
