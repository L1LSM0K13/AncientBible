Psalms.
Chapter 115.
(116) Alleluia. I am well pleased, because the Lord will listen to the voice of my supplication. 
Because he has inclined his ear to me, therefore will I call upon him while I live. 
The pangs of death compassed me; the dangers of hell found me: I found affliction and sorrow. 
Then I called on the name of the Lord: O Lord, deliver my soul. 
The Lord is merciful and righteous; yes, our God has pity. 
The Lord preserves the simple: I was brought low, and he delivered me. 
Return to your rest, O my soul; for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you. 
For he has delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. 
I shall be well-pleasing before the Lord in the land of the living. 
(115) Alleluia. I believed, therefore I have spoken: but I was greatly afflicted. 
And I said in mine amazement, Every man is a liar. 
What shall I render to the Lord for all the things wherein he has rewarded me? 
I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. 
I will pay my vows to the Lord, in the presence of all his people. 
Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. 
O Lord, I am your servant; I am your servant, and the son of your handmaid: you have burst by bonds asunder. 
I will offer to you the sacrifice of praise, and will call upon the name of the Lord. 
I will pay my vows to the Lord, in the presence of all his people, 
in the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of you, Jerusalem.
