Psalms.
Chapter 148.
Alleluia, a Psalm of Aggaeus and Zacharias. Praise you⌃ the Lord from the heavens: praise him in the highest. 
Praise you⌃ him, all his angels: praise you⌃ him, all his hosts. 
Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you⌃ stars and light. 
Praise him, you⌃ heavens of heavens, and the water that is above the heavens. 
Let them praise the name of the Lord: for he spoke, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created. 
He has established them for ever, even for ever and ever: he has made an ordinance, and it shall not pass away. 
Praise the Lord from the earth, you⌃ serpents, and all deeps. 
Fire, hail, snow, ice, stormy wind; the things that perform his word. 
Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars: 
wild beasts, and all cattle; reptiles, and winged birds: 
kings of the earth, and all peoples; princes, and all judges of the earth: 
young men and virgins, old men with youths: 
let them praise the name of the Lord: for his name only is exalted; his praise is above the earth and heaven, 
and he shall exalt the horn of his people, there is a hymn for all his saints, even of the children of Israel, a people who draw near to him.
