Jezekiel.
Chapter 2.
This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And I saw and fell upon my face, and heard the voice of one speaking: and he said to me, Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I will speak to you. 
And the Spirit came upon me, and took me up, and raised me, and set me on my feet: and I heard him speaking to me. 
And he said to me, Son of Man, I send you forth to the house of Israel, them that provoke me; who have provoked me, they and their fathers to this day. 
And you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord. 
Whether then indeed they shall hear or fear, (for it is a provoking house,) yet they shall know that you are a prophet in the midst of them. 
And you, son of man, fear them not, nor be dismayed at their face; (for they will madden and will rise up against you round about, and you dwell in the midst of scorpions): be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their countenance, for it is a provoking house. 
And you shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear or fear: for it is a provoking house. 
And you, son of man, hear him that speaks to you; be not you provoking, as the provoking house: open your mouth, and eat what I give you. 
And I looked, and behold, a hand stretched out to me, and in it a volume of a book. 
And he unrolled it before me: and in it the front and the back were written upon: and there was written in it Lamentation, and mournful song, and woe.
