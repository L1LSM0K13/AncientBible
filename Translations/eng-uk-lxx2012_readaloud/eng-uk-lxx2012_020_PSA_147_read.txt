Psalms.
Chapter 147.
Alleluia, a Psalm of Aggaeus and Zacharias. Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Sion. 
For he has strengthened the bars of your gates; he has blessed your children within you. 
He makes your borders peaceful, and fills you with the flour of wheat. 
He sends his oracle to the earth: his word will run swiftly. 
He gives snow like wool: he scatters the mist like ashes. 
Casting forth his ice like morsels: who shall stand before his cold? 
He shall send out his word, and melt them: he shall blow with his wind, and the waters shall flow. 
He sends his word to Jacob, his ordinances and judgements to Israel. 
He has not done so to any other nation; and he has not shown them his judgements.
