Psalms.
Chapter 6.
For the End, a Psalm of David amongst the Hymns for the eighth. O Lord, rebuke me not in your wrath, neither chasten me in your anger. 
Pity me, O Lord; for I am weak: heal me, O Lord; for my bones are vexed. 
My soul also is grievously vexed: but you, O Lord, how long? 
Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: save me for your mercy's sake. 
For in death no man remembers you: and who will give you thanks in Hades? 
I am wearied with my groaning; I shall wash my bed every night; I shall water my couch with tears. 
Mine eye is troubled because of my wrath; I am worn out because of all my enemies. 
Depart from me, all you⌃ that work iniquity; for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. 
The Lord has listened to my petition; the Lord has accepted my prayer. 
Let all mine enemies be put to shame and sore troubled: let them be turned back and grievously put to shame speedily.
