Psalms.
Chapter 95.
(96) When the house was built after the Captivity, a Song of David. Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth. 
Sing to the Lord, bless his name: proclaim his salvation from day to day. 
Publish his glory amongst the Gentiles, his wonderful works amongst all people. 
For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: he is terrible above all gods. 
For all the gods of the heathen are devils: but the Lord made the heavens. 
Thanksgiving and beauty are before him: holiness and majesty are in his sanctuary. 
Bring to the Lord, you⌃ families of the Gentiles, bring to the Lord glory and honour. 
Bring to the Lord the glory becoming his name: take offerings, and go into his courts. 
Worship the Lord in his holy court: let all the earth tremble before him. 
Say amongst the heathen, The Lord reigns: for he has established the world so that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people in righteousness. 
Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth exult; let the sea be moved, and the fullness of it. 
The plains shall rejoice, and all things in them: then shall all the trees of the wood exult before the presence of the Lord: 
for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth; he shall judge the world in righteousness, and the people with his truth.
