Exodus.
Chapter 18.
And Jothor the priest of Madiam, the father-in-law of Moses, heard of all that the Lord did to his people Israel; for the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt. 
And Jothor the father-in-law of Moses, took Sepphora the wife of Moses after she had been sent away, 
and her two sons: the name of the one was Gersam, his father saying, I was a sojourner in a strange land; — 
and the name of the second Eliezer, saying, For the God of my father is my helper, and he has rescued me out of the hand of Pharao. 
And Jothor the father-in-law of Moses, and his sons and his wife, went forth to Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped on the mount of God. 
And it was told Moses, saying, Behold, your father-in-law Jothor is coming to you, and your wife and two sons with him. 
And Moses went forth to meet his father-in-law, and did him reverence, and kissed him, and they embraced each other, and he brought them into the tent. 
And Moses related to his father-in-law all things that the Lord did to Pharao and all the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the labour that had befallen them in the way, and that the Lord had rescued them out of the hand of Pharao, and out of the hand of the Egyptians. 
And Jothor was amazed at all the good things which the Lord did to them, forasmuch as he rescued them out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharao. 
And Jothor said, Blessed be the Lord, because he has rescued them out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharao. 
Now know I that the Lord is great above all gods, because of this, wherein they attacked them. 
And Jothor the father-in-law of Moses took whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for God, for Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat bread with the father-in-law of Moses before God. 
And it came to pass after the morrow that Moses sat to judge the people, and all the people stood by Moses from morning till evening. 
And Jothor having seen all that Moses did to the people, says, What is this that you do to the people? therefore sit you alone, and all the people stand by you from morning till evening? 
And Moses says to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to seek judgement from God. 
For whenever there is a dispute amongst them, and they come to me, I give judgement upon each, and I teach them the ordinances of God and his law. 
And the father-in-law of Moses said to him, You do not this thing rightly, 
you will wear away with intolerable weariness, both those and all this people which is with you: this thing is hard, you will not be able to endure it yourself alone. 
Now then listen to me, and I will advise you, and God shall be with you: be you to the people in the things pertaining to God, and you shall bring their matters to God. 
And you shall testify to them the ordinances of God and his law, and you shall show to them the ways in which they shall walk, and the works which they shall do. 
And do you look out for yourself out of all the people able men, fearing God, righteous men, hating pride, and you shall set over the people captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens. 
And they shall judge the people at all times, and the too burdensome matter they shall bring to you, but they shall judge the smaller cases; so they shall relieve you and help you. 
If you will do this thing, God shall strengthen you, and you shall be able to attend, and all this people shall come with peace into their own place. 
And Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did whatever he said to him. 
And Moses chose out able men out of all Israel, and he made them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties and captains of tens over the people. 
And they judged the people at all times; and every too burdensome matter they brought to Moses, but every light matter they judged themselves. 
And Moses dismissed his father-in-law, and he returned to his own land.
