Psalms.
Chapter 100.
(101) A Psalm of David. I will sing to you, O Lord, of mercy and judgement; I will sing a psalm, 
and I will be wise in a blameless way. When will you come to me? I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house. 
I have not set before mine eyes any unlawful ting; I have hated transgressors. 
A perverse heart has not cleaved to me; I have not known an evil man, forasmuch as he turns away from me. 
Him that privily speaks against his neighbour, him have I driven from me: he that is proud in look and insatiable in heart, —with him I have not eaten. 
Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walked in a perfect way, the same ministered to me. 
The proud doer lived not in the midst of my house; the unjust speaker prospered not in my sight. 
Early did I kill all the sinners of the land, that I might destroy out of the city of the Lord all that work iniquity.
