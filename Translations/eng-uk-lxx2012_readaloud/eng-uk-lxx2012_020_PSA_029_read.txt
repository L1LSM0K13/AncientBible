Psalms.
Chapter 29.
(30) For the end, a Psalm and Song at the dedication of the house of David. I will exalt you, O Lord; for you have lifted me up, and not caused mine enemies to rejoice over me. 
O Lord my God, I cried to you, and you did heal me. 
O Lord, you have brought up my soul from Hades, you have delivered me from amongst them that go down to the pit. 
Sing to the Lord, you⌃ his saints, and give thanks for the remembrance of his holiness. 
For anger is in his wrath, but life in his favour: weeping shall wait for the evening, but joy shall be in the morning. 
And I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved. 
O Lord, in your good pleasure you did add strength to my beauty: but you did turn away your face, and I was troubled. 
To you, O Lord, will I cry; and to my God will I make supplication. 
What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to destruction? Shall the dust give praise to you? or shall it declare your truth? 
The Lord heard, and had compassion upon me; the Lord is become my helper. 
You have turned my mourning into joy for me: you have tore off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness; 
that my glory may sing praise to you, and I may not be pierced with sorrow. O Lord my God, I will give thanks to you for ever.
