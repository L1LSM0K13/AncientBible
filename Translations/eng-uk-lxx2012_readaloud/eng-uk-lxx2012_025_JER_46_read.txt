Jeremias.
Chapter 46.
And it came to pass in the ninth month of Sedekias king of Juda, that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and they besieged it. 
And in the eleventh year of Sedekiass, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up. 
And all the leaders of the king of Babylon went in, and sat in the middle gate, Marganasar, and Samagoth, and Nabusachar, and Nabusaris, Nagargas, Naserrabamath, and the rest of the leaders of the king of Babylon, 
and they sent, and took Jeremias out of the court of the prison, and gave him in charge to Godolias the son of Achicam, the son of Saphan: and they brought him out, and he sat in the midst of the people. 
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias in the court of the prison, saying, 
Go and say to Abdemelech the Ethiopian, Thus said the Lord God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good. 
But I will save you in that day, and I will by no means deliver you into the hands of the men before whom you are afraid. 
For I will surely save you, and you shall by no means fall by the sword; and you shall find your life, because you did trust in me, says the Lord.
