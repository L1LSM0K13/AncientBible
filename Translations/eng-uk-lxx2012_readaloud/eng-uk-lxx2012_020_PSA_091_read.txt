Psalms.
Chapter 91.
(92) A Psalm of a Song for the Sabbath-day. It is a good thing to give thanks to the Lord, and to sing praises to your name, O you Most High; 
to proclaim your mercy in the morning, and your truth by night, 
on a lute of ten strings, with a song on the harp. 
For you, O Lord, have made me glad with your work: and in the operations of your hands will I exult. 
How have your works been magnified, O Lord! your thoughts are very deep. 
A foolish man will not know, and a senseless man will not understand this. 
When the sinners spring up as the grass, and all the workers of iniquity have watched; it is that they may be utterly destroyed for ever. 
But you, O Lord, are most high for ever. 
For, behold, your enemies shall perish; and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 
But my horn shall be exalted as the horn of a unicorn; and mine old age with rich mercy. 
And mine eye has seen mine enemies, and mine ear shall hear the wicked that rise up against me. 
The righteous shall flourish as a palm tree: he shall be increased as the cedar in Libanus. 
They that are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God. 
Then shall they be increased in a fine old age; and they shall be prosperous; that they may declare 
that the Lord my God is righteous, and there is no iniquity in him.
