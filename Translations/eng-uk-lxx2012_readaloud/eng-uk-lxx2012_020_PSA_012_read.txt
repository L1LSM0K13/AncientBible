Psalms.
Chapter 12.
(13) For the end, a Psalm of David. How long, O Lord, will you forget me? for ever? how long will you turn away your face from me? 
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrows in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over me? 
Look on me, listen to me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep in death; 
lest at any time mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: my persecutors will exult if ever I should be moved. 
But I have hoped in your mercy; my heart shall exult in your salvation. 
I will sing to the Lord who has dealt bountifully with me, and I will sing psalms to the name of the Lord most high.
