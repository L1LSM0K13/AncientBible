Exodus.
Chapter 11.
And the Lord said to Moses, I will yet bring one plague upon Pharao and upon Egypt, and after that he will send you forth thence; and whenever he sends you forth with every thing, he will indeed drive you out. 
Speak therefore secretly in the ears of the people, and let every one ask of his neighbour jewels of silver and gold, and raiment. 
And the Lord gave his people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, and they lent to them; and the man Moses was very great before the Egyptians, and before Pharao, and before his servants. 
And Moses said, These things says the Lord, About midnight I go forth into the midst of Egypt. 
And every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharao that sits on the throne, even to the firstborn of the woman-servant that is by the mill, and to the firstborn of all cattle. 
And there shall be a great cry through all the land of Egypt, such as has not been, and such shall not be repeated any more. 
But amongst all the children of Israel shall not a dog snarl with his tongue, either at man or beast; that you may know how wide a distinction the Lord will make between the Egyptians and Israel. 
And all these your servants shall come down to me, and do me reverence, saying, Go forth, you and all the people over whom you preside, and afterwards I will go forth. 
And Moses went forth from Pharao with wrath. And the Lord said to Moses, Pharao will not listen to you, that I may greatly multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt. 
And Moses and Aaron wrought all these signs and wonders in the land of Egypt before Pharao; and the Lord hardened the heart of Pharao, and he did not listen to send forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
