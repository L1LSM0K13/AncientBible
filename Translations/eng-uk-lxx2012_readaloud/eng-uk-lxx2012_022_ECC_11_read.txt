Ecclesiastes.
Chapter 11.
Send forth your bread upon the face of the water: for you shall find it after many days. 
Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for you know not what evil there shall be upon the earth. 
If the clouds be filled with rain, they pour it out upon the earth: and if a tree fall southward, or if it fall northward, in the place where the tree shall fall, there it shall be. 
He that observes the wind sows not; and he that looks at the clouds will not reap. 
Amongst whom none knows what is the way of the wind: as the bones are hid in the womb of a pregnant woman, so you shall not know the works of God, even all things whatever he shall do. 
In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening let not your hand be slack: for you know not what sort shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether both shall be good alike. 
Moreover the light is sweet, and it is good for the eyes to see the sun. 
For even if a man should live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that comes is vanity. 
Rejoice, O young man, in your youth; and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart blameless, but not in the sight of your eyes: yet know that for all these things God will bring you into judgement. 
Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh: for youth and folly are vanity.
