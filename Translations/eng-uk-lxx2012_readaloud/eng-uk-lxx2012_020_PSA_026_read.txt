Psalms.
Chapter 26.
(27) A Psalm of David, before he was anointed. The Lord is my light and my Saviour; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the defender of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 
When evil-doers drew near against me to eat up my flesh, my persecutors and mine enemies, they fainted and fell. 
Though an army should set itself in array against me, my heart shall not be afraid: though war should rise up against me, in this am I confident. 
One thing have I asked of the Lord, this will I earnestly seek: that I should dwell in the house of the Lord, all the days of my life, that I should behold the fair beauty of the Lord, and survey his temple. 
For in the day of mine afflictions he hid me in his tabernacle: he sheltered me in the secret of his tabernacle; he set me up on a rock. 
And now, behold, he has lifted up mine head over mine enemies: I went round and offered in his tabernacle the sacrifice of joy; I will sing even sing psalms to the Lord. 
Hear, O Lord, my voice which I have uttered aloud: pity me, and listen to me. 
My heart said to you, I have diligently sought your face: your face, O Lord, I will seek. 
Turn not your face away from me, turn not you away from your servant in anger: be you my helper, forsake me not; and, O God my Saviour, overlook me not. 
For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord has taken me to himself. 
Teach me, O Lord, in your way, and guide me in a right path, because of mine enemies. 
Deliver me not over to the desire of them that afflict me; for unjust witnesses have risen up against me, and injustice has lied within herself. 
I believe that I shall see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. 
Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and let your heart be strengthened: yes wait on the Lord.
