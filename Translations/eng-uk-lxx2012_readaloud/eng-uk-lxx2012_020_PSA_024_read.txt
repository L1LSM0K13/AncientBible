Psalms.
Chapter 24.
(25) A Psalm of David. To you, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul. 
O my God, I have trusted in you: let me not be confounded, neither let mine enemies laugh me to scorn. 
For none of them that wait on you shall in any wise be ashamed: let them be ashamed that transgress without cause. 
Show me your ways, O Lord; and teach me your paths. 
Lead me in your truth, and teach me: for you are God my Saviour: and I have waited on you all the day. 
Remember your compassions, O Lord, and your mercies, for they are from everlasting. 
Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my sins of ignorance: remember me according to your mercy, for your goodness' sake, O Lord. 
Good and upright is the Lord: therefore will he instruct sinners in the way. 
The meek will he guide in judgement: the meek will he teach his ways. 
All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth to them that seek his covenant and his testimonies. 
For your name's sake, O Lord, do you also be merciful to my sin; for it is great. 
Who is the man that fears the Lord? he shall instruct him in the way which he has chosen. 
His soul shall dwell in prosperity; and his seed shall inherit the earth. 
The Lord is the strength of them that fear him; and his covenant is to manifest truth to them. 
Mine eyes are continually to the Lord; for he shall draw my feet out of the snare. 
Look upon me, and have mercy upon me; for I am an only child and poor. 
The afflictions of my heart have been multiplied; deliver me from my distresses. 
Look upon mine affliction and my trouble; and forgive all my sins. 
Look upon mine enemies; for they have been multiplied; and they have hated me with unjust hatred. 
Keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I have hoped in you. 
The harmless and upright joined themselves to me: for I waited for you, O Lord. 
Deliver Israel, O God, out of all his afflictions.
