Psalms.
Chapter 60.
(61) For the end, amongst the Hymns of David. O God, listen to my petition; attend to my prayer. 
From the ends of the earth have I cried to you, when my heart was in trouble: you lifted me up on a rock you did guide me: 
because you were my hope, a tower of strength from the face of the enemy. 
I will dwell in your tabernacle for ever; I will shelter myself under the shadow of your wings. Pause. 
For you, o God, have heard my prayers; you have given an inheritance to them that fear your name. 
You shall add days to the days of the king; you shall lengthen his years to all generations. 
He shall endure for ever before God: which of them will seek out his mercy and truth? 
So will I sing to your name for ever and ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
