Sirach.
Chapter 8.
Strive not with a mighty man' lest you fall into his hands. 
Be not at variance with a rich man, lest he overweigh you: for gold has destroyed many, and perverted the hearts of kings. 
Strive not with a man that is full of tongue, and heap not wood upon his fire. 
Jest not with a rude man, lest your ancestors be disgraced. 
Reproach not a man that turns from sin, but remember that we are all worthy of punishment. 
Dishonour not a man in his old age: for even some of us wax old. 
Rejoice not over your greatest enemy being dead, but remember that we die all. 
Despise not the discourse of the wise, but acquaint yourself with their proverbs: for of them you shall learn instruction, and how to serve great men with ease. 
Miss not the discourse of the elders: for they also learnt of their fathers, and of them you shall learn understanding, and to give answer as need requires. 
Kindle not the coals of a sinner, lest you be burnt with the flame of his fire. 
Rise not up in anger at the presence of an injurious person, lest he lie in wait to entrap you in your words 
Lend not to him that is mightier than yourself; for if you lend him, count it but lost. 
Be not surety above your power: for if you be surety, take care to pay it. 
Go not to law with a judge; for they will judge for him according to his honour. 
Travel not by the way with a bold fellow, lest he become grievous to you: for he will do according to his own will, and you shall perish with him through his folly. 
Strive not with an angry man, and go not with him into a solitary place: for blood is as nothing in his sight, and where there is no help, he will overthrow you. 
Consult not with a fool; for he can’t keep counsel. 
Do no secret thing before a stranger; for you know not what he will bring forth. 
Open not your heart to every man, lest he requite you with a shrewd turn.
