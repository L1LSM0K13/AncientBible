Psalms.
Chapter 28.
(29) A Psalm of David on the occasion of the solemn assembly of the Tabernacle. Bring to the Lord, you⌃ sons of God, bring to the Lord young rams; bring to the Lord glory and honour. 
Bring to the Lord glory, due to his name; worship the lord in his holy court. 
The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: the God of glory has thundered: the Lord is upon many waters. 
The voice of the Lord is mighty; the voice of the Lord is full of majesty. 
There is the voice of the Lord who breaks the cedars; the Lord will break the cedars of Libanus. 
And he will beat them small, even Libanus itself, like a calf; and the beloved one is as a young unicorn. 
There is a voice of the Lord who divides a flame of fire. 
A voice of the Lord who shakes the wilderness; the Lord will shake the wilderness of Cades. 
The voice of the Lord strengthens the hinds, and will uncover the thickets: and in his temple every one speaks of his glory. 
The Lord will dwell on the waterflood: and the Lord will sit a king for ever. 
The Lord will give strength to his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.
