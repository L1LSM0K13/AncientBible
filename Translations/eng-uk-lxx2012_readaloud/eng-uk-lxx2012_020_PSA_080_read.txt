Psalms.
Chapter 80.
(81) For the end, a Psalm for Asaph, concerning the wine presses. Rejoice you⌃ in God our helper; shout aloud to the God of Jacob. 
Take a psalm, and produce the timbrel, the pleasant lute with the harp. 
Blow the trumpet at the new moon, in the glorious day of your feast. 
For this is an ordinance for Israel, and a statute of the God of Jacob. 
He made it to be a testimony in Joseph, when he came forth out of the land of Egypt: he heard a language which he understood not. 
He removed his back from burdens: his hands slaved in making the baskets. 
You did call upon me in trouble, and I delivered you; I heard you in the secret place of the storm: I proved you at the water of Strife. Pause. 
Hear, my people, and I will speak to you, O Israel; and I will testify to you: if you will listen to me; 
there shall be no new god in you; neither shall you worship a strange god. 
For I am the Lord your God, that brought you out of the land of Egypt: open your mouth wide, and I will fill it. 
But my people listened not to my voice; and Israel gave no heed to me. 
So I let them go after the ways of their own hearts: they will go on in their own ways. 
If my people had listened to me, if Israel had walked in my ways, 
I should have put down their enemies very quickly, and should have laid my hand upon those that afflicted them. 
The Lord's enemies should have lied to him: but their time shall be for ever. 
And he fed them with the fat of wheat; and satisfied them with honey out of the rock.
