Esias.
Chapter 53.
O Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? 
We brought a report as of a child before him; he is as a root in a thirsty land: he has no form nor comeliness; and we saw him, but he had no form nor beauty. 
But his form was ignoble, and inferior to that of the children of men; he was a man in suffering, and acquainted with the bearing of sickness, for his face is turned from us: he was dishonoured, and not esteemed. 
He bears our sins, and is pained for us: yet we accounted him to be in trouble, and in suffering, and in affliction. 
But he was wounded on account of our sins, and was bruised because of our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and by his bruises we were healed. 
All we as sheep have gone astray; every one has gone astray in his way; and the Lord gave him up for our sins. 
And he, because of his affliction, opens not his mouth: he was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is dumb, so he opens not his mouth. 
In his humiliation his judgement was taken away: who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken away from the earth: because of the iniquities of my people he was led to death. 
And I will give the wicked for his burial, and the rich for his death; for he practised no iniquity, nor craft with his mouth. 
The Lord also is pleased to purge him from his stroke. If you⌃ can give an offering for sin, your soul shall see a long-lived seed: 
the Lord also is pleased to take away from the travail of his soul, to show him light, and to form him with understanding; to justify the just one who serves many well; and he shall bear their sins. 
Therefore he shall inherit many, and he shall divide the spoils of the mighty; because his soul was delivered to death: and he was numbered amongst the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and was delivered because of their iniquities.
