Zacharias.
Chapter 3.
And the Lord showed me Jesus the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and the Devil stood on his right hand to resist him. 
And the Lords said to the Devil, 
The Lord rebuke you, O Devil, even the Lord that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: behold! is not this as a brand plucked from the fire? 
Now Jesus was clothed in filthy raiment, and stood before the angel. 
And the Lord answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy raiment from him: and he said to him, Behold, I have taken away your iniquities: and clothe you⌃ him with a long robe, 
and place a pure mitre upon his head. So they placed a pure mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments: and the angel of the Lord stood by. 
And the angel of the Lord testified to Jesus, saying, 
Thus says the Lord Almighty; If you will walk in my ways, and take heed to my charges, then shall you judge my house: and if you will diligently keep my court, then will I give you men to walk in the midst of these that stand here. 
Hear now, Jesus the high priest, you, and your neighbours that are sitting before you: for they are diviners, for, behold, I bring forth my servant The Branch. 
For as for the stone which I have set before the face of Jesus, on the one stone are seven eyes: behold, I am digging a trench, says the Lord Almighty, and I will search out all the iniquity of that land in one day. 
In that day, says the Lord Almighty, you⌃ shall call together every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.
