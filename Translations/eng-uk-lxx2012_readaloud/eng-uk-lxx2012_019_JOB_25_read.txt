Job.
Chapter 25.
Then Baldad the Sauchite answered and said, 
What beginning or fear is his—even he that makes all things in the highest? 
For let none think that there is a respite for robbers: and upon whom will there not come a snare from him? 
For how shall a mortal be just before the Lord? or who that is born of a woman shall purify himself? 
If he gives an order to the moon, then it shines not; and the stars are not pure before him. 
But alas! man is corruption, and the son of man a worm.
