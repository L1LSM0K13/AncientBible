Psalms.
Chapter 81.
(82) A Psalm for Asaph. God stands in the assembly of gods; and in the midst of them will judge gods. 
How long will you⌃ judge unrighteously, and accept the persons of sinners? Pause. 
Judge the orphan and poor: do justice to the low and needy. 
Rescue the needy, and deliver the poor out of the hand of the sinner. 
They know not, nor understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth shall be shaken. 
I have said, You⌃ are gods; and all of you children of the Most High. 
But you⌃ die as men, and fall as one of the princes. 
Arise, O God, judge the earth: for you shall inherit all nations.
