Psalms.
Chapter 114.
(115) Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory, because of your mercy and your truth; 
lest at any time the nations should say, Where is their God? 
But our God has done in heaven and on earth, whatever he has pleased. 
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the works of men's hands. 
They have a mouth, but they can’t speak; they have eyes, but they can’t see: 
they have ears, but they can’t hear; they have noses, but they can’t smell; 
they have hands, but they can’t handle; they have feet, but they can’t walk: they can’t speak through their throat. 
Let those that make them become like to them, and all who trust in them. 
The house of Israel trusts in the Lord: he is their helper and defender. 
The house of Aaron trusts in the Lord: he is their helper and defender. 
They that fear the Lord trust in the Lord: he is their helper and defender. 
The Lord has remembered us, and blessed us: he has blessed the house of Israel, he has blessed the house of Aaron. 
He has blessed them that fear the Lord, both small and great. 
The Lord add blessings to you and to your children. 
Blessed are you⌃ of the Lord, who made the heaven and the earth. 
The heaven of heavens belongs to the Lord: but he has given the earth to the sons of men. 
The dead shall not praise you, O Lord, nor any that go down to Hades. 
But we, the living, will bless the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.
