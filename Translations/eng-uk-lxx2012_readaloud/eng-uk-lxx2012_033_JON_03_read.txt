Jonas.
Chapter 3.
And the word of the Lord came to Jonas the second time, saying, 
Rise, go to Nineve, the great city, and preach in it according to the former preaching which I spoke to you of. 
And Jonas arose, and went to Nineve, as the Lord had spoken. Now Nineve was an exceeding great city, of about three days' journey. 
And Jonas began to enter into the city about a day's journey, and he proclaimed, and said, Yet three days, and Nineve shall be overthrown. 
And the men of Nineve believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloths, from the greatest of them to the least of them. 
And the word reached the king of Nineve, and he arose from off his throne, and took off his raiment from him, and put on sackcloth, and sat on ashes. 
And proclamation was made, and it was commanded in Nineve by the king an by his great men, saying, Let not men, or cattle, or oxen, or sheep, taste any thing, nor feed, nor drink water. 
So men and cattle were clothed with sackcloths, and cried earnestly to God; and they turned every one from their evil way, and from the iniquity that was in their hands, saying, 
Who knows if God will repent, and turn from his fierce anger, and so we shall not perish? 
And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil ways; and God repented of the evil which he had said he would do to them; and he did it not.
