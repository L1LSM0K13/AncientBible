Psalms.
Chapter 84.
(85) For the end, a Psalm for the sons of Core. O Lord, you have taken pleasure in your land: you have turned back the captivity of Jacob. 
You have forgiven your people their transgressions; you have covered all their sins. Pause. 
You has caused all your wrath to cease: you have turned from your fierce anger. 
Turn us, O God of our salvation, and turn your anger away from us. 
Wouldest you be angry with us for ever? or will you continue your wrath from generation to generation? 
O God, you will turn and quicken us; and your people shall rejoice in you. 
Show us your mercy, O Lord, and grant us your salvation. 
I will hear what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak peace to his people, and to his saints, and to those that turn their heart towards him. 
Moreover his salvation is near them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. 
Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each other. 
Truth has sprung out of the earth; and righteousness has looked down from heaven. 
For the Lord will give goodness; and our land shall yield her fruit. 
Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set his steps in the way.
