Psalms.
Chapter 98.
(99) A Psalm of David. The Lord reigns; —let the people rage; it is he that sits upon the cherubs, let the earth be moved. 
The Lord is great in Sion, and is high over all the people. 
Let them give thanks to your great name; for it is terrible and holy. 
And the king's honour loves judgement; you have prepared equity, you have wrought judgement and justice in Jacob. 
Exalt you⌃ the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy. 
Moses and Aaron amongst his priests, and Samuel amongst them that call upon his name; they called upon the Lord, and he heard them. 
He spoke to them in a pillar of cloud; they kept his testimonies, and the ordinances which he gave them. 
O Lord our God, you heard them; O God, you became propitious to them, though you did take vengeance on all their devices. 
Exalt you⌃ the Lord our God, and worship at his holy mountain; for the Lord our God is holy.
