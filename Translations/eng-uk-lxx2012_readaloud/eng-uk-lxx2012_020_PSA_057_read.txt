Psalms.
Chapter 57.
(58) For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial. If you⌃ do indeed speak righteousness, then do you⌃ judge rightly, you⌃ sons of men. 
For you⌃ work iniquities in your hearts in the earth: your hands plot unrighteousness. 
Sinners have gone astray from the womb: they go astray from the belly: they speak lies. 
Their venom is like that of a serpent; as that of a deaf asp, and that stops her ears; 
which will not hear the voice of charmers, nor heed the charm prepared skilfully by the wise. 
God has crushed their teeth in their mouth: God has broken the cheek-teeth of the lions. 
They shall utterly pass away like water running through: he shall bend his bow till they shall fail. 
They shall be destroyed as melted wax: the fire has fallen and they have not seen the sun. 
Before your thorns feel the white thorn, he shall swallow you up as living, as in his wrath. 
The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance of the ungodly: he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner. 
And a man shall say, Verily then there is a reward for the righteous: verily there is a God that judges them in the earth.
