Psalms.
Chapter 19.
(20) For the end, a Psalm of David. The Lord hear you in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend you. 
Send you help from the sanctuary, and aid you out of Sion. 
Remember all your sacrifice, and enrich your whole burnt offering. Pause. 
Grant you according to your heart, and fulfil all your desire. 
We will exult in your salvation, and in the name of our God shall we be magnified: the Lord fulfil all your petitions. 
Now I know that the Lord has saved his Christ: he shall hear him from his holy heaven: the salvation of his right hand is mighty. 
Some glory in chariots, and some in horses: but we will glory in the name of the Lord our God. 
They are overthrown and fallen: but we are risen, and have been set upright. 
O Lord, save the king: and hear us in whatever day we call upon you.
