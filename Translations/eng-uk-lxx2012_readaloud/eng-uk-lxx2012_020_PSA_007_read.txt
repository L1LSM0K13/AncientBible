Psalms.
Chapter 7.
A Psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Chusi the Benjamite. O Lord my God, in you have I trusted: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me. 
Lest at any time the enemy seize my soul as a lion, while there is none to ransom, nor to save. 
O Lord my God, if I have done this; (if there is unrighteousness in my hands;) 
if I have requited with evil those who requited me with good; may I then perish empty by means of my enemies. 
Let the enemy persecute my soul, an take it; and let him trample my life on the ground, and lay my glory in the dust. Pause. 
Arise, O Lord, in your wrath; be exalted in the utmost boundaries of mine enemies: awake, O Lord my God, according to the decree which you did command. 
And the congregation of the nations shall compass you: and for this cause do you return on high. 
The Lord shall judge the nations: judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to my innocence that is in me. 
Oh let the wickedness of sinners come to an end; and then you shall direct the righteous, O God that search the hearts and reins. 
My help is righteous, coming from God who saves the upright in heart. 
God is a righteous judge, and strong, and patient, not inflicting vengeance every day. 
If you⌃ will not repent, he will furbish his sword; he has bent his bow, and made it ready. 
And on it he has fitted the instruments of death; he has completed his arrows for the raging ones. 
Behold, he has travailed with unrighteousness, he has conceived trouble, and brought forth iniquity. 
He has opened a pit, and dug it up, and he shall fall into the ditch which he has made. 
His trouble shall return on his own head, and his unrighteousness shall come down on his own crown. 
I will give thanks to the Lord according to his righteousness; I will sing to the name of the Lord most high.
