Psalms.
Chapter 112.
(113) Alleluia. Praise the Lord, you⌃ servants of his, praise, the name of the Lord. 
Let the name of the Lord be blessed, from this present time and for ever. 
From the rising of the sun to his setting, the name of the Lord is to be praised. 
The Lord is high above all the nations; his glory is above the heavens. 
Who is as the Lord our God? who dwells in the high places, 
and yet looks upon the low things in heaven, and on the earth: 
who lifts up the poor from the earth, and raises up the needy from the dunghill; 
to set him with princes, even with the princes of his people: 
who settles the barren woman in a house, as a mother rejoicing over children.
