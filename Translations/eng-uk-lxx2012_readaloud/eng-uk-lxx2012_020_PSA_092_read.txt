Psalms.
Chapter 92.
(93) For the day before the Sabbath, when the land was first inhabited, the praise of a Song by David. The Lord reigns; he has clothed himself with honour: the Lord has clothed and girded himself with strength; for he has established the world, which shall not be moved. 
Your throne is prepared of old: you are from everlasting. 
The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, the rivers have lifted up their voices, 
at the voices of many waters: the billows of the sea are wonderful: the Lord is wonderful in high places. 
Your testimonies are made very sure: holiness becomes your house, O Lord, for ever.
