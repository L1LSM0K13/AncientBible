Zacharias.
Chapter 2.
And I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a man, and in his hand a measuring line. 
And I said to him, Whither go you? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth of it, and what is the length of it. 
And, behold, the angel that spoke with me stood by, and another angel went forth to meet him, 
and spoke to him, saying, Run and speak to that young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be fully inhabited by reason of the abundance of men and cattle in the midst of her. 
And I will be to her, says the Lord, a wall of fire round about, and I will be for a glory in the midst of her. 
Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, says the Lord: for I will gather you from the four winds of heaven, says the Lord, 
even to Sion: deliver yourselves, you⌃ that dwell with the daughter of Babylon. 
For thus says the Lord Almighty; After the glory has he sent me to the nations that spoiled you: for he that touches you is as one that touches the apple of his eye. 
For, behold, I bring my hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to them that serve them: and you⌃ shall know that the Lord Almighty has sent me. 
Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Sion: for, behold, I come, and will dwell in the midst of you, says the Lord. 
And many nations shall flee for refuge to the Lord in that day, and they shall be for a people to him, and they shall dwell in the midst of you: and you shall know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you. 
And the Lord shall inherit Juda his portion in the holy land, and he will yet choose Jerusalem. 
Let all flesh fear before the Lord: for he has risen up from his holy clouds.
