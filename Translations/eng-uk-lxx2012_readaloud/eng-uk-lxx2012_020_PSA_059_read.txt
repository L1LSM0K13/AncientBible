Psalms.
Chapter 59.
(60) For the end, for them that shall yet be changed; for an inscription by David for instruction, when he had burnt Mesopotamia of Syria, and Syria Sobal, and Joab had returned and struck in the valley of salt twelve thousand. O God, you have rejected and destroyed us; you have been angry, yet have pitied us. 
You have shaken the earth, and troubled it; heal its breaches, for it has been shaken. 
You have shown your people hard things: you have made us drink the wine of astonishment. 
You have given a token to them that fear you, that they might flee from the bow. Pause. 
That your beloved ones may be delivered; save with your right hand, and hear me. 
God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, and divide Sicima, and measure out the valley of tents. 
Galaad is mine, and Manasse is mine; and Ephraim is the strength of my head; 
Judas is my king; Moab is the cauldron of my hope; over Idumea will I stretch out my shoe; the Philistines have been subjected to me. 
Who will lead me into the fortified city? who will guide me as far a Idumea? 
Will not you, O God, who have cast us off? and will not you, O God, go forth with our forces? 
Give us help from trouble: for vain is the deliverance of man. 
In God will we do valiantly; and he shall bring to nothing them that harass us.
