Psalms.
Chapter 79.
(80) For the end, for alternate strains, a testimony for Asaph, a Psalm concerning the Assyrian. Attend, O Shepherd of Israel, who guide Joseph like a flock; you who sit upon the cherubs, manifest yourself; 
before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasse, stir up your power, and come to deliver us. 
Turn us, O God, and cause your face to shine; and we shall be delivered. 
O Lord God of hosts, how long are you angry with the prayer of your servant? 
You will feed us with bread of tears; and will cause us to drink tears by measure. 
You has made us a strife to our neighbours; and our enemies have mocked at us. 
Turn us, O Lord God of hosts, and cause your face to shine; and we shall be saved. Pause. 
You have transplanted a vine out of Egypt: you have cast out the heathen, and planted it. 
You made a way before it, and did cause its roots to strike, and the land was filled with it. 
Its shadow covered the mountains, and its shoots equalled the goodly cedars. 
It sent forth its branches to the sea, and its shoots to the river. 
Therefore have you broken down its hedge, while all that pass by the way pluck it? 
The boar out of the wood has laid it waste, and the wild beast has devoured it. 
O God of hosts, turn, we pray you: look on us from heaven, and behold and visit this vine; 
and restore that which your right hand has planted: and look on the son of man whom you did strengthen for yourself. 
It is burnt with fire and dug up: they shall perish at the rebuke of your presence. 
Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand, and upon the son of man whom you did strengthen for yourself. 
So will we not depart from you: you shall quicken us, and we will call upon your name. 
Turn us, O Lord God of hosts, and make your face to shine; and we shall be saved.
