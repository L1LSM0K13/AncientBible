Psalms.
Chapter 22.
(23) A Psalm of David. The Lord tends me as a shepherd, and I shall lack nothing. 
In a place of green grass, there he has made me dwell: he has nourished me by the water of rest. 
He has restored my soul: he has guided me into the paths of righteousness, for his name's sake. 
Yes, even if I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will not be afraid of evils: for you are with me; your rod and your staff, these have comforted me. 
You has prepared a table before me in presence of them that afflict me: you have thoroughly anointed my head with oil; and your cup cheers me like the best wine. 
Your mercy also shall follow me all the days of my life: and my dwelling shall be in the house of the Lord for a very long time.
