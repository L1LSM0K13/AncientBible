Psalms.
Chapter 93.
(94) A Psalm of David for the fourth day of the week. The Lord is a God of vengeance; the God of vengeance has declared himself. 
Be you exalted, you that judge the earth: render a reward to the proud. 
How long shall sinners, O Lord, how long shall sinners boast? 
They will utter and speak unrighteousness; all the workers of iniquity will speak so. 
They have afflicted your people, O Lord, and hurt your heritage. 
They have slain the widow and fatherless, and murdered the stranger. 
And they said, The Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob understand. 
Understand now, you⌃ simple amongst the people; and you⌃ fools, at length be wise. 
He that planted the ear, does he not hear? or he that formed the eye, does not he perceive? 
He that chastises the heathen, shall not he punish, even he that teaches man knowledge? 
The Lord knows the thoughts of men, that they are vain. 
Blessed is the man whoever you shall chasten, O Lord, and shall teach him out of your law; 
to give him rest from evil days, until a pit be digged for the sinful one. 
For the Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance; 
until righteousness return to judgement, and all the upright in heart shall follow it. Pause. 
Who will rise up for me against the transgressors? or who will stand up with me against the workers of iniquity? 
If the Lord had not helped me, my soul had almost sojourned in Hades. 
If I said, My foot has been moved; 
your mercy, O Lord, helped me. O Lord, according to the multitude of my griefs within my heart, your consolation have soothed my soul. 
Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with you, which frames mischief by an ordinance? 
They will hunt for the soul of the righteous, and condemn innocent blood. 
But the Lord was my refuge; and my God the helper of my hope. 
And he will recompense to them their iniquity and their wickedness: the Lord our God shall utterly destroy them.
