Psalms.
Chapter 37.
(38) A Psalm of David for remembrance concerning the Sabbath-day. O Lord, rebuke me not in your wrath, neither chasten me in your anger. 
For your weapons are fixed in me, and you have pressed your hand heavily upon me. 
For there is no health in my flesh because of your anger; there is no peace to my bones because of my sins. 
For my transgressions have gone over mine head: they have pressed heavily upon me like a weighty burden. 
My bruises have become noisome and corrupt, because of my foolishness. 
I have been wretched and bowed down continually: I went with a mourning countenance all the day. 
For my soul is filled with mockings; and there is no health in my flesh. 
I have been afflicted and brought down exceedingly: I have roared for the groaning of my heart. 
But all my desire is before you; and my groaning is not hidden from you. 
My heart is troubled, my strength has failed me; and the light of mine eyes is not with me. 
My friends and my neighbours drew near before me, and stood still; and my nearest of kin stood afar off. 
While they pressed hard upon me that sought my soul: and they that sought my hurt spoke vanities, and devised deceits all the day. 
But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and was as a dumb man not opening his mouth. 
And I was as a man that hears not, and who has no reproofs in his mouth. 
For I hoped in you, O Lord: you will hear, O Lord my God. 
For I said, Lest mine enemies rejoice against me: for when my feet were moved, they spoke boastingly against me. 
For I am ready for plagues, and my grief is continually before me. 
For I will declare mine iniquity, and be distressed for my sin. 
But mine enemies live, and are mightier than I: and they that hate me unjustly are multiplied. 
They that reward evil for good slandered me; because I followed righteousness. 
Forsake me not, O Lord my God: depart not from me. 
Draw near to my help, O Lord of my salvation.
