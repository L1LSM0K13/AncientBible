Psalms.
Chapter 111.
(112) Alleluia. Blessed is the man that fears the Lord: he will delight greatly in his commandments. 
His seed shall be mighty in the earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed. 
Glory and riches shall be in his house; and his righteousness endures for evermore. 
To the upright light has sprung up in darkness: he is pitiful, and merciful, and righteous. 
The good man is he that pities and lends: he will direct his affairs with judgement. 
For he shall not be moved for ever; the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. 
He shall not be afraid of any evil report: his heart is ready to trust in the Lord. 
His heart is established, he shall not fear, till he shall see his desire upon his enemies. 
He has dispersed abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures for evermore: his horn shall be exalted with honour. 
The sinner shall see and be angry, he shall gnash his teeth, and consume away: the desire of the sinner shall perish.
