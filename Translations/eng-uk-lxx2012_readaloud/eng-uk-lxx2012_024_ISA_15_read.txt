Esias.
Chapter 15.
THE WORD AGAINST THE LAND OF MOAB. By night the land of Moab shall be destroyed; for by night the wall of the land of Moab shall be destroyed. 
Grieve for yourselves; for even Debon, where your altar is, shall be destroyed: there shall you⌃ go up to weep, over Nabau of the land of Moab: howl you⌃: baldness shall be on every head, and all arms shall be wounded. 
Gird yourselves with sackcloth in her streets: and lament upon her roofs, and in her streets, and in her ways; howl all of you with weeping. 
For Esebon and Eleale have cried: their voice was heard to Jassa: therefore the loins of the region of Moab cry aloud; her soul shall know. 
The heart of the region of Moab cries within her to Segor; for it is as a heifer of three years old: and on the ascent of Luith they shall go up to you weeping by the way of Aroniim: she cries, Destruction, and trembling. 
The water of Nemerim shall be desolate, and the grass thereof shall fail: for there shall be no green grass. 
Shall Moab even thus be delivered? for I will bring the Arabians upon the valley, and they shall take it. 
For the cry has reached the border of the region of Moab, even of Agalim; and her howling has gone as far as the well of Aelim. 
And the water of Dimon shall be filled with blood: for I will bring Arabians upon Dimon, and I will take away the seed of Moab, and Ariel, and the remnant of Adama.
