Psalms.
Chapter 127.
(128) A Song of Degrees. Blessed are all they that fear the Lord; who walk in his ways. 
You shall eat the labours of your hands: blessed are you, and it shall be well with you. 
Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine on the sides of your house: your children as young olive-plants round about your table. 
Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that fears the Lord. 
May the Lord bless you out of Sion; and may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life. 
And may you see your children's children. Peace be upon Israel.
