Psalms.
Chapter 62.
(63) A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Idumea. O God, my God, I cry to you early; my soul has thirsted for you: how often has my flesh longed after you, in a barren and trackless and dry land! 
Thus have I appeared before you in the sanctuary, that I might see your power and your glory. 
For your mercy is better than life: my lips shall praise you. 
Thus will I bless you during my life: I will lift up my hands in your name. 
Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness; and my joyful lips shall praise your name. 
Forasmuch as I have remembered you on my bed: in the early seasons I have meditated on you. 
For you have been my helper, and in the shelter of your wings will I rejoice. 
My soul has kept very close behind you: your right hand has upheld me. 
But they vainly sought after my soul; they shall go into the lowest parts o the earth. 
They shall be delivered up to the power of the sword; they shall be portions for foxes. 
But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that swears by him shall be praised; for the mouth of them that speak unjust things has been stopped.
