Psalms.
Chapter 51.
(52) For the end, a Psalm of instruction by David, when Doec the Idumean came and told Saul, and said to him, David is gone to the house of Abimelech. Why do you, O mighty man, boast of iniquity in your mischief? All the day 
your tongue has devised unrighteousness; like a sharpened razor you have wrought deceit. 
You have loved wickedness more than goodness; unrighteousness better than to speak righteousness. Pause. 
You has loved all words of destruction, and a deceitful tongue. 
Therefore may God destroy you for ever, may he pluck you up and utterly remove you from your dwelling, and your root from the land of the living. Pause. 
And the righteous shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him, and say, 
Behold the man who made not God his help; but trusted in the abundance of his wealth, and strengthened himself in his vanity. 
But I am as a fruitful olive in the house of God: I have trusted in the mercy of God for ever, even for evermore. 
I will give thanks to you for ever, for you have done it: and I will wait on your name; for it is good before the saints.
