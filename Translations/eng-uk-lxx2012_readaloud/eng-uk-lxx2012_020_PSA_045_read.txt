Psalms.
Chapter 45.
(46) For the end, for the sons of Core; a Psalm concerning secret things. God is our refuge and strength, a help in the afflictions that have come heavily upon us. 
Therefore will we not fear when the earth is troubled, and the mountains are removed into the depths of the seas. 
Their waters have roared and been troubled, the mountains have been troubled by his might. Pause. 
The flowings of the river gladden the city of God: the Most High has sanctified his tabernacle. 
God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her with his countenance. 
The nations were troubled, the kingdoms tottered: he uttered his voice, the earth shook. 
The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our helper. Pause. 
Come, and behold the works of the Lord, what wonders he has achieved on the earth. 
Putting an end to wars as for the ends of the earth; he will crush the bow, and break in pieces the weapon, and burn the bucklers with fire. 
Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted amongst the nations, I will be exalted in the earth. 
The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our helper.
