Psalms.
Chapter 142.
(143) A Psalm of David, when his son pursued him. O Lord, attend to my prayer: listen to my supplication in your truth; hear me in your righteousness. 
And enter not into judgement with your servant, for in your sight shall no man living be justified. 
For the enemy has persecuted my soul; he has brought my life down to the ground; he has made me to dwell in a dark place, as those that have been long dead. 
Therefore my spirit was grieved in me; my heart was troubled within me. 
I remembered the days of old; and I meditated on all your doings: yes, I meditated on the works of your hands. 
I spread forth my hands to you; my soul thirsts for you, as a dry land. Pause. 
Hear me speedily, O Lord; my spirit has failed; turn not away your face from me, else I shall be like to them that go down to the pit. 
Cause me to hear your mercy in the morning; for I have hoped in you; make known to me, O Lord, the way wherein I should walk; for I have lifted up my soul to you. 
Deliver me from mine enemies, O Lord; for I have fled to you for refuge. 
Teach me to do your will; for you are my God; your good Spirit shall guide me in the straight way. 
You shall quicken me, O Lord, for your name's sake; in your righteousness you shall bring my soul out of affliction. 
And in your mercy you will destroy mine enemies, and will destroy all those that afflict my soul; for I am your servant.
