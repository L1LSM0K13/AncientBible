Psalms.
Chapter 141.
(142) A Psalm of instruction for David, when he was in the cave, —a Prayer. I cried to the Lord with my voice; with my voice I made supplication to the Lord. 
I will pour out before him my supplication: I will declare before him mine affliction. 
When my spirit was fainting within me, then you knew my paths; in the very way wherein I was walking, they hid a snare for me. 
I looked on my right hand, and behold, for there was none that noticed me; refuge failed me; and there was none that cared for my soul. 
I cried to you, O Lord, and said, You are my hope, my portion in the land of the living. 
Attend to my supplication, for I am brought very low; deliver me from them that persecute me; for they are stronger than I. 
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name, O Lord; the righteous shall wait for me, until you recompense me.
