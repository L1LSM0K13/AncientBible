Psalms.
Chapter 144.
(145) David's Psalm of praise. I will exalt you, my God, my king; and I will bless your name for ever and ever. 
Every day will I bless you, and I will praise your name for ever and ever. 
The Lord is great, and greatly to be praised; and there is no end to his greatness. 
Generation after generation shall praise your works, and tell of your power. 
And they shall speak of the glorious majesty of your holiness, and recount your wonders. 
And they shall speak of the power of your terrible acts; and recount your greatness. 
They shall utter the memory of the abundance of your goodness, and shall exult in your righteousness. 
The Lord is compassionate, and merciful; long suffering, and abundant in mercy. 
The Lord is good to those that wait on him; and his compassions are over all his works. 
Let all your works, O Lord, give thanks to you; and let your saints bless you. 
They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom, and talk of your dominion; 
to make known to the sons of men your power, and the glorious majesty of your kingdom. 
Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures through all generations. The Lord is faithful in his words, and holy in all his works. 
The Lord supports all that are falling, and sets up all that are broken down. 
The eyes of all wait upon you; and you give them their food in due season. 
You open your hands, and fill every living thing with pleasure. 
The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. 
The Lord is near to all that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. 
He will perform the desire of them that fear him: and he will hear their supplication, and save them. 
The Lord preserves all that love him: but all sinners he will utterly destroy. 
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
