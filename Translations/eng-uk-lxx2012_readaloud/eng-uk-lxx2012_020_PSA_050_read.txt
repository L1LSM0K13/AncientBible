Psalms.
Chapter 50.
(51) For the end, a Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, when he had gone to Bersabee. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to your great mercy; and according to the multitude of your compassions blot out my transgression. 
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 
For I am conscious of mine iniquity; and my sin is continually before me. 
Against you only have I sinned, and done evil before you: that you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged. 
For, behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother conceive me. 
For, behold, you love truth: you have manifested to me the secret and hidden things of your wisdom. 
You shall sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be purified: you shall wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. 
You shall cause me to hear gladness and joy: the afflicted bones shall rejoice. 
Turn away your face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. 
Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit in my inward parts. 
Cast me not away from your presence; and remove not your holy Spirit from me. 
Restore to me the joy of your salvation: establish me with your directing Spirit. 
Then will I teach transgressors your ways; and ungodly men shall turn to you. 
Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation: and my tongue shall joyfully declare your righteousness. 
O Lord, you shall open my lips; and my mouth shall declare your praise. 
For if you desired sacrifice, I would have given it: you will not take pleasure in whole burnt offerings. 
Sacrifice to God is a broken spirit: a broken and humbled heart God will not despise. 
Do good, O Lord, to Sion in your good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be built. 
Then shall you be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, offering, and whole burnt sacrifices: then shall they offer calves upon your altar.
