Psalms.
Chapter 126.
(127) A Song of Degrees. Except the Lord build the house, they that build labour in vain: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman watches in vain. 
It is vain for you to rise early: you⌃ rise up after resting, you⌃ that eat the bread of grief; while he gives sleep to his beloved. 
Behold, the inheritance of the Lord, children, the reward of the fruit of the womb. 
As arrows in the hand of a mighty man; so are the children of those who were outcasts. 
Blessed is the man who shall satisfy his desire with them: they shall not be ashamed when they shall speak to their enemies in the gates.
