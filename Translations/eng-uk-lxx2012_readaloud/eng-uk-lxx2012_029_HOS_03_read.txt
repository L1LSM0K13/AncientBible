Osee.
Chapter 3.
And the Lord said to me, Go yet, and love a woman that loves evil things, an adulteress, even as the Lord loves the children of Israel, and they have respect to strange gods, and love cakes of dried grapes. 
So I hired her to myself for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer of barley, and a flagon of wine. 
And I said to her, You shall wait for me many days; and you shall not commit fornication, neither shall you be for another man; and I will be for you. 
For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an altar, and without a priesthood, and without manifestations. 
And afterward shall the children of Israel return, and shall seek the Lord their God, and David their king; and shall be amazed at the Lord and at his goodness in the latter days.
