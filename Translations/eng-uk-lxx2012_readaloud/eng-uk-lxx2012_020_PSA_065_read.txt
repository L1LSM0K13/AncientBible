Psalms.
Chapter 65.
(66) For the end, a Song of Psalm of resurrection. Shout to God, all the earth. 
O sing praises to his name; give glory to his praise. 
Say to God, How awful are your works! through the greatness of your power your enemies shall lie to you. 
Let all the earth worship you, and sing to you; let them sing to your name. Pause. 
Come and behold the works of God; he is terrible in his counsels beyond the children of men. 
Who turns the sea into dry land; they shall go through the river on foot; there shall we rejoice in him, 
who by his power is Lord over the age, his eyes look upon the nations; let not them that provoke him be exalted in themselves. Pause. 
Bless our God, you⌃ Gentiles, and make the voice of his praise to be heard; 
who quickens my soul in life, and does not suffer my feet to be moved. 
For you, O God, has proved us; you have tried us with fire as silver is tried. 
You brought us into the snare; you laid afflictions on our back. 
You did mount men upon our heads; we went through the fire and water; but you brought us out into a place of refreshment. 
I will go into your house with whole burnt offerings; I will pay you my vows, 
which my lips framed, and my mouth uttered in my affliction. 
I will offer to you whole burnt sacrifices full of marrow, with incense and rams; I will sacrifice to you oxen with goats. Pause. 
Come, hear, and I will tell, all you⌃ that fear God, how great things he has done for my soul. 
I cried to him with my mouth, and exalted him with my tongue. 
If I have regarded iniquity in my heart, let not the Lord listen to me. 
Therefore God has listened to me; he has attended to the voice of my prayer. 
Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
