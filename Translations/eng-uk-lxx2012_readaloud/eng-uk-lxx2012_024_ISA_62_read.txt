Esias.
Chapter 62.
For Sion's sake I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as light, and my salvation burn as a torch. 
And the Gentiles shall see your righteousness, and kings your glory: and one shall call you by a new name, which the Lord shall name. 
And you shall be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God. 
And you shall no more be called Forsaken; and your land shall no more be called Desert: for you shall be called My Pleasure, and your land Inhabited: for the Lord has taken pleasure in you, and your land shall be inhabited. 
And as a young man lives with a virgin, so shall your sons dwell in you: and it shall come to pass that as a bridegroom will rejoice over a bride, so will the Lord rejoice over you. 
And on your walls, O Jerusalem, have I set watchmen all day and all night, who shall never cease making mention of the Lord. 
For there is none like you, when he shall have established, and made Jerusalem a praise on the earth. 
For the Lord has sworn by his glory, and by the might of his arm, I will no more give your corn and your provisions to your enemies; nor shall strangers any more drink your wine, for which you have laboured. 
But they that have gathered them shall eat them, and they shall praise the Lord; and they that have gathered the grapes shall drink thereof in my holy courts. 
Go through my gates, and make a way for my people; and cast the stones out of the way; lift up a standard for the Gentiles. 
For behold, the Lord has proclaimed to the end of the earth, say you⌃ to the daughter of Sion, Behold, your Saviour has come to you, having his reward and his work before his face. 
And one shall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord: and you shall be called a city sought out, and not forsaken.
