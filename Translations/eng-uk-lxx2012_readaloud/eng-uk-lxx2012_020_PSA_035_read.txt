Psalms.
Chapter 35.
(36) For the end, by David the servant of the Lord. The transgressor, that he may sin, says within himself, that there is no fear of God before his eyes. 
For he has dealt craftily before him, to discover his iniquity and hate it. 
The words of his mouth are transgression and deceit: he is not inclined to understand how to do good. 
He devises iniquity on his bed; he gives himself to every evil way; and does not abhor evil. 
O Lord, your mercy is in the heaven; and your truth reaches to the clouds. 
Your righteousness is as the mountains of God, your judgements are as a great deep: O Lord, you will preserve men and beasts. 
How have you multiplied your mercy, O God! so the children of men shall trust in the shelter of your wings. 
They shall be fully satisfied with the fatness of your house; and you shall cause them to drink of the full stream of your delights. 
For with you is the fountain of life: in your light we shall see light. 
Extend your mercy to them that know you; and your righteousness to the upright in heart. 
Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of sinners move me. 
There have all the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast out, and shall not be able to stand.
