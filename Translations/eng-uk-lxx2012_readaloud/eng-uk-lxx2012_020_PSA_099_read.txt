Psalms.
Chapter 99.
(100) A Psalm for Thanksgiving. Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth. 
Serve the Lord with gladness; come before his presence with exultation. 
Know that the Lord he is God; he made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with hymns; give thanks to him, praise his name. 
For the Lord is good, his mercy is for ever; and his truth endures to generation and generation.
