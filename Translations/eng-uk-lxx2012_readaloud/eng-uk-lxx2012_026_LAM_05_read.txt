Lamentations.
Chapter 5.
Remember, O Lord, what has happened to us: behold, and look on our reproach. 
Our inheritance has been turned away to aliens, our houses to strangers: 
we are become orphans, we have no father, our mothers are as widows. 
We have drunk our water for money; our wood is sold to us for a burden on our neck: 
we have been persecuted, we have laboured, we have had no rest. 
Egypt gave the hand to us, Assur to their own satisfaction. 
Our fathers sinned, and are not: we have borne their iniquities. 
Servants have ruled over us: there is none to ransom us out of their hand. 
We shall bring in our bread with danger of our lives, because of the sword of the wilderness. 
Our skin is blackened like an oven; they are convulsed, because of the storms of famine. 
They humbled the women in Sion, the virgins in the cities of Juda. 
Princes were hanged up by their hands: the elders were not honoured. 
The chosen men lifted up the voice in weeping, and the youths fainted under the wood. 
And the elders ceased from the gate, the chosen men ceased from their music. 
The joy of our heart has ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. 
The crown has fallen from our head: yes, woe to us! for we have sinned. 
For this has grief come; our heart is sorrowful: for this our eyes are darkened. 
Over the mountain of Sion, because it is made desolate, foxes have walked therein. 
But you, O Lord, shall dwell for ever; your throne shall endure to generation and generation. 
Therefore will you utterly forget us, and abandon us a long time? 
Turn us, O Lord, to you, and we shall be turned; and renew our days as before. 
For you have indeed rejected us; you have been very angry against us.
