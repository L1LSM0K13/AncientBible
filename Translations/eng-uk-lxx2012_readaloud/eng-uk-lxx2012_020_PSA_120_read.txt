Psalms.
Chapter 120.
(121) A Song of Degrees. I lifted up mine eyes to the mountains, whence my help shall come. 
My help shall come from the Lord, who made the heaven and the earth. 
Let not your foot be moved; and let not your keeper slumber. 
Behold, he that keeps Israel shall not slumber nor sleep. 
The Lord shall keep you: the Lord is your shelter upon your right hand. 
The sun shall not burn you by day, neither the moon by night. 
May the Lord preserve you from all evil: the Lord shall keep your soul. 
The Lord shall keep your coming in, and your going out, from henceforth and even for ever.
