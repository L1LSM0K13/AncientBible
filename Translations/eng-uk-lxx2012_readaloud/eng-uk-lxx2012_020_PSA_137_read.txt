Psalms.
Chapter 137.
(138) A Psalm for David, of Aggaeus and Zacharias. I will give you thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart; and I will sing psalms to you before the angels; for you have heard all the words of my mouth. 
I will worship towards your holy temple, and give thanks to your name, on account of your mercy and your truth; for you have magnified your holy name above every thing. 
In whatever day I shall call upon you, hear me speedily; you shall abundantly provide me with your power in my soul. 
Let all the kings of the earth, o Lord, give thanks to you; for they have heard all the words of your mouth. 
And let them sing in the ways of the Lord; for great is the glory of the Lord. 
For the Lord is high, and yet regards the lowly; and he knows high things from afar off. 
Though I should walk in the midst of affliction, you will quicken me; you have stretched forth your hands against the wrath of mine enemies, and your right hand has saved me. 
O Lord, you shall recompense them on my behalf: your mercy, O Lord, endures for ever: overlook not the works of your hands.
