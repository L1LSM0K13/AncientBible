Psalms.
Chapter 69.
(70) For the end, by David for a remembrance, that the Lord may save me. Draw near, O God, to my help. 
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek my soul: let them be turned backward and put to shame, that wish me evil. 
Let them that say to me, Aha, aha, be turned back and put to shame immediately. 
Let all that seek you exult and be glad in you: and let those that love your salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. 
But I am poor and needy; O God, help me: you are my helper and deliverer, O Lord, delay not.
