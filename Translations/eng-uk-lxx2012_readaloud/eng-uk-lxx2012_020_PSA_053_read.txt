Psalms.
Chapter 53.
(54) For the end, amongst Hymns of instruction by David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Behold, is not David hid with us? Save me, O God, by your name, and judge me by your might. 
O God, hear my prayer; listen to the words of my mouth. 
For strangers have risen up against me, and mighty men have sought my life: they have not set God before them. Pause. 
For behold! God assists me; and the Lord is the helper of my soul. 
He shall return evil to mine enemies; utterly destroy them in your truth. 
I will willingly sacrifice to you: I will give thanks to your name, O Lord; for it is good. 
For you have delivered me out of all affliction, and mine eye has seen my desire upon mine enemies.
