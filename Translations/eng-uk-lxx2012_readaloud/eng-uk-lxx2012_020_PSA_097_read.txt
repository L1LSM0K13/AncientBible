Psalms.
Chapter 97.
(98) A Psalm of David. Sing to the Lord a new song; for the Lord has wrought wonderful works, his right hand, and his holy arm, have wrought salvation for him. 
The Lord has made known his salvation, he has revealed his righteousness in the sight of the nations. 
He has remembered his mercy to Jacob, and his truth to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 
Shout to God, all the earth; sing, and exult, and sing psalms. 
Sing to the Lord with a harp, with a harp, and the voice of a psalm. 
With trumpets of metal, and the sound of a trumpet of horn make a joyful noise to the Lord before the king. 
Let the sea be moved, and the fullness of it; the world, and they that dwell in it. 
The rivers shall clap their hands together; the mountains shall exult. 
For he is come to judge the earth; he shall judge the world in righteousness, and the nations in uprightness.
