Psalms.
Chapter 146.
(147) Alleluia, a Psalm of Aggaeus and Zacharias. Praise you⌃ the Lord: for psalmody is a good thing; let praise be sweetly sung to our God. 
The Lord builds up Jerusalem; and he will gather together the dispersed of Israel. 
He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds. 
He numbers the multitudes of stars; and calls them all by names. 
Great is our Lord, and great is his strength; and his understanding is infinite. 
The Lord lifts up the meek; but brings sinners down to the ground. 
Begin the song with thanksgiving to the Lord; sing praises on the harp to our God: 
who covers the heaven with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who causes grass to spring up on the mountains, and green herb for the service of men; 
and gives cattle their food, and to the young ravens that call upon him. 
He will not take pleasure in the strength of a horse; neither is he well-pleased with the legs of a man. 
The Lord takes pleasure in them that fear him, and in all that hope in his mercy.
