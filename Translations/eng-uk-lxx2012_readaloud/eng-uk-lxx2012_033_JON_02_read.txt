Jonas.
Chapter 2.
Now the Lord had commanded a great whale to swallow up Jonas: and Jonas was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights. 
And Jonas prayed to the Lord his God out of the belly of the whale, 
and said, I cried in my affliction to the Lord my God, and he listened to me, even to my cry out of the belly of hell: you heard my voice. 
You did cast me into the depths of the heart of the sea, and the floods compassed me: all your billows and your waves have passed upon me. 
And I said, I am cast out of your presence: shall I indeed look again towards your holy temple? 
Water was poured around me to the soul: the lowest deep compassed me, my head went down 
to the clefts of the mountains; I went down into the earth, whose bars are the everlasting barriers: yet, O Lord my God, let my ruined life be restored. 
When my soul was failing me, I remembered the Lord; and may my prayer come to you into your holy temple. 
They that observe vanities and lies have forsaken their own mercy. 
But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of praise and thanksgiving: all that I have vowed I will pay to you, the Lord of my salvation. 
And the whale was commanded by the Lord, and it cast up Jonas on the dry land.
