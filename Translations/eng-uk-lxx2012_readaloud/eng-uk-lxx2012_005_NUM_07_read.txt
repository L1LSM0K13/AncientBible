Chapter 7.
And it came to pass in the day in which Moses finished the setting-up of the tabernacle, that he anointed it, and consecrated it, and all its furniture, and the altar and all its furniture, he even anointed them, and consecrated them. 
And the princes of Israel brought gifts, twelve princes of their fathers' houses: these were the heads of tribes, these are they that presided over the numbering. 
And they brought their gift before the Lord, six covered waggons, and twelve oxen; a waggon from two princes, and a calf from each: and they brought them before the tabernacle. 
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
Take of them, and they shall be for the works of the services of the tabernacle of witness: and you shall give them to the Levites, to each one according to his ministration. 
And Moses took the waggons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.

And four waggons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari according to their ministrations, by Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
