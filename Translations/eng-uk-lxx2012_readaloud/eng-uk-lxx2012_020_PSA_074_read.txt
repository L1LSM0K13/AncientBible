Psalms.
Chapter 74.
(75) For the end, Destroy not, a Psalm of a Song for Asaph. We will give thanks to you, O God, we will give thanks, and call upon your name: I will declare all your wonderful works. 
When I shall take a set time, I will judge righteously. 
The earth is dissolved, and all that dwell in it: I have strengthened its pillars. Pause. 
I said to the transgressors, Do not transgress; and to the sinners, Lift not up the horn. 
Lift not up your horn on high; speak not unrighteousness against God. 
For good comes neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert mountains. 
For God is the judge; he puts down one, and raises up another. 
For there is a cup in the hand of the Lord, full of unmingled wine; and he has turned it from side to side, but its dregs have not been wholly poured out; all the sinners of the earth shall drink them. 
But I will exult for ever: I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 
And I will break all the horns of sinners; but the horns of the righteous one shall be exalted.
