Psalms.
Chapter 27.
(28) A Psalm of David. To you, O Lord, have I cried; my God, be not silent towards me: lest you be silent towards me, and so I should be likened to them that go down to the pit. 
Listen to the voice of my supplication, when I pray to you, when I lift up my hands towards your holy temple. 
Draw not away my soul with sinners, and destroy me not with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace with their neighbours, but evils are in their hearts. 
Give them according to their works, and according to the wickedness of their devices: give them according to the works of their hands; render their recompense to them. 
Because they have not attended to the works of the Lord, even to the works of his hands, you shall pull them down, and shall not build them up. 
Blessed be the Lord, for he has listened to the voice of my petition. 
The Lord is my helper and my defender; my heart has hoped in him, and I am helped: my flesh has revived, and willingly will I give praise to him. 
The Lord is the strength of his people, and the saving defender of his anointed. 
Save your people, and bless your inheritance: and take care of them, and lift them up for ever.
