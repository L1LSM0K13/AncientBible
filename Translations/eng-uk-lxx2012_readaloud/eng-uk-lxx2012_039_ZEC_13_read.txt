Zacharias.
Chapter 13.
In that day every place shall be opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for removal and for separation. 
And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord of hosts, that I will utterly destroy the names of the idols from off the land, and there shall be no longer any remembrance of them: and I will cut off the false prophets and the evil spirit from the land. 
And it shall come to pass, if a man will yet prophesy, that his father and his mother which gave birth to him shall say to him, You shall not live; for you have spoken lies in the name of the Lord: and his father and his mother who gave him birth shall bind him as he is prophesying. 
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision when he prophesies; and they shall clothe themselves with a garment of hair, because they have lied. 
And one shall say, I am not a prophet, for I am a tiller of the ground, for a man brought me up thus from my youth. 
And I will say to him, What are these wounds between your hands? and he shall say, Those with which I was wounded in my beloved house. 
Awake, O sword, against my shepherds, and against the man who is my citizen, says the Lord Almighty: strike the shepherds, and draw out the sheep: and I will bring mine hand upon the little ones. 
And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, says the Lord, two parts thereof shall be cut off and perish; but the third shall be left therein. 
And I will bring the third part through the fire, and I will try them as silver is tried, and I will prove them as gold is proved: they shall call upon my name, and I will hear them, and say, This is my people: and they shall say, The Lord is my God.
