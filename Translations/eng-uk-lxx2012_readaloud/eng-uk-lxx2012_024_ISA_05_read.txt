Esias.
Chapter 5.
Now I will sing to my beloved a song of my beloved concerning my vineyard. My beloved had a vineyard on a high hill in a fertile place. 
And I made a hedge round it, and dug a trench, and planted a choice vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and dug a place for the wine-vat in it: and I waited for it to bring forth grapes, and it brought forth thorns. 
And now, you⌃ dwellers in Jerusalem, and every man of Juda, judge between me and my vineyard. 
What shall I do any more to my vineyard, that I have not done to it? Whereas I expected it to bring forth grapes, but it has brought forth thorns. 
And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be for a spoil; and I will pull down its walls, and it shall be left to be trodden down. 
And I will forsake my vineyard; and it shall not be pruned, nor dug, and thorns shall come up upon it as on barren land; and I will command the clouds to rain no rain upon it. 
For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Juda his beloved plant: I expected it to bring forth judgement, and it brought forth iniquity; and not righteousness, but a cry. 
Woe to them that join house to house, and add field to field, that they may take away something of their neighbour's: will you⌃ dwell alone upon the land? 
For these things have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts: for though many houses should be built, many and fair houses shall be desolate, and there shall be no inhabitants in them. 
For where ten yoke of oxen plough the land shall yield one , and he that sows six homers shall produce three measures. 
Woe to them that rise up in the morning, and follow strong drink; who wait at it till evening: for the wine shall inflame them. 
For they drink wine with harp, and lute, and drums, and pipes: but they regard not the works of the Lord, and consider not the works of his hands. 
Therefore my people have been taken captive, because they know not the Lord: and there has been a multitude of dead bodies, because of hunger and of thirst for water. 
Therefore hell has enlarged its desire and opened its mouth without ceasing: and her glorious and great, and her rich and her pestilent men shall go down into it. 
And the mean man shall be brought low, and the great man shall be disgraced, and the lofty eyes shall be brought low. 
But the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgement, and the holy God shall be glorified in righteousness. 
And they that were spoiled shall be fed as bulls, and lambs shall feed on the waste places of them that are taken away. 
Woe to them that draw sins to them as with a long rope, and iniquities as with a thong of the heifer's yoke: 
who say, Let him speedily hasten what he will do, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may know it. 
Woe to them that call evil good, and good evil; who make darkness light, and light darkness; who make bitter sweet, and sweet bitter. 
Woe to them that are wise in their own conceit, and knowing in their own sight. 
Woe to the strong ones of you that drink wine, and the mighty ones that mingle strong drink: 
who justify the ungodly for rewards, and take away the righteousness of the righteous. 
Therefore as stubble shall be burnt by a coal of fire, and shall be consumed by a violent flame, their root shall be as chaff, and their flower shall go up as dust: for they rejected the law of the Lord of hosts, and insulted the word of the Holy One of Israel. 
Therefore the Lord of hosts was greatly angered against his people, and he reached forth his hand upon them, and struck them: and the mountains were troubled, and their carcasses were as dung in the midst of the way: yet for all this his anger has not been turned away, but his hand is yet raised. 
Therefore shall he lift up a signal to the nations that are afar, and shall hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they are coming very quickly. 
They shall not hunger nor be weary, neither shall they slumber nor sleep; neither shall they loose their girdles from their loins, neither shall their shoe-latchets be broken. 
Whose arrows are sharp, and their bows bent; their horses' hoofs are counted as solid rock: their chariot-wheels are as a storm. 
They rage as lions, and draw near as a lion's whelps: and he shall seize, and roar as a wild beast, and he shall cast them forth, and there shall be none to deliver them. 
And he shall roar on account of them in that day, as the sound of the swelling sea; and they shall look to the land, and, behold, there shall be thick darkness in their perplexity.
