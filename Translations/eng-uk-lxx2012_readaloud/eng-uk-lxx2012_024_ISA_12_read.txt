Esias.
Chapter 12.
And in that day you shall say, I will bless you, O Lord; for you were angry with me, but you have turned aside your wrath, and have pitied me. 
Behold, my God is my Saviour; I will trust in him, and not be afraid: for the Lord is my glory and my praise, and is become my salvation. 
Draw you⌃ therefore water with joy out of the wells of salvation. 
And in that day you shall say, sing to the Lord, call aloud upon his name, proclaim his glorious deeds amongst the Gentiles; make mention that his name is exalted. 
Sing praise to the name of the Lord; for he has done great things: declare this in all the earth. 
Exalt and rejoice, you⌃ that dwell in Sion: for the Holy One of Israel is exalted in the midst of her.
