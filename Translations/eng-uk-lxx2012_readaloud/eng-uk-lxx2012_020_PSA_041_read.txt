Psalms.
Chapter 41.
(42) For the end, a Psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core. As the hart earnestly desires the fountains of water, so my soul earnestly longs for you, O God. 
My soul has thirsted for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? 
My tears have been bread to me day and night, while they daily said to me, Where is your God? 
I remembered these things, and poured out my soul in me, for I will go to the place of your wondrous tabernacle, even to the house of God, with a voice of exultation and thanksgiving and of the sound of those who keep festival. 
Therefore are you very sad, O my soul? and therefore do you trouble me? hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; he is the salvation of my countenance. 
O my God, my soul has been troubled within me: therefore will I remember you from the land of Jordan, and of the Ermonites, from the little hill. 
Deep calls to deep at the voice of your cataracts: all your billows and your waves have gone over me. 
By day the Lord will command his mercy, and manifest it by night: with me is prayer to the God of my life. 
I will say to God, You are my helper; why have you forgotten me? therefore do I go sad of countenance, while the enemy oppresses me? 
While my bones were breaking, they that afflicted me reproached me; while they said to me daily, Where is your God? 
Therefore are you very sad, O my soul? and therefore do you trouble me? hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; he is the health of my countenance, and my God.
