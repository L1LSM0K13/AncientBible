Osee.
Chapter 14.
Samaria shall be utterly destroyed: for she has resisted her God; they shall fall by the sword, and their sucklings shall be dashed against the ground, and their women with child ripped up. 
Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God; for the people have fallen through your iniquities. 
Take with you words, and turn to the Lord your God: speak to him, that you⌃ may not receive the reward of unrighteousness, but that you⌃ may receive good things: and we will render in return the fruit of our lips. 
Assur shall never save us; we will not mount on horseback; we will no longer say to the works of our hands, Our gods. He who is in you shall pity the orphan. 
I will restore their dwellings, I will love them truly: for he has turned away my wrath from him. 
I will be as dew to Israel: he shall bloom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Libanus. 
His branches shall spread, and he shall be as a fruitful olive, and his smell shall be as the smell of Libanus. 
They shall return, and dwell under his shadow: they shall live and be satisfied with corn, and he shall flower as a vine: his memorial shall be to Ephraim as the wine of Libanus. 
What has he to do any more with idols? I have afflicted him, and I will strengthen him: I am as a leafy juniper tree. From me is your fruit found. 
Who is wise, and will understand these things? or prudent, and will know them? for the ways of the Lord are straight, and the righteous shall walk in them: but the ungodly shall fall therein.
