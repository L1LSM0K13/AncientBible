Ezra.
Chapter 5.
And Aggaeus the prophet, and Zacharias the son of Addo, prophesied a prophesy to the Jews in Juda and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even to them. 
Then rose up Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedec, and began to build the house of God that was in Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God assisting them. 
At the same time came there upon them Thanthanai, the governor on this side the river, and Satharbuzanai, and their fellow-servants, and spoke thus to them, Who has ordained a decree for you to build this house, and to provide this preparation? 
Then they spoke thus to them, What are the names of the men that build this city? 
But the eyes of God were upon the captivity of Juda, and they did not cause them to cease till the decree was brought to Darius; and then was sent by the tribute-gatherer concerning this 
the copy of a letter, which Thanthanai, the governor of the part on this side the river, and Satharbuzanai, and their fellow-servants the Apharsachaeans who were on this side of the river, sent to king Darius. 
They sent an account to him, and thus it was written in it: All peace to king Darius. 
Be it known to the king, that we went into the land of Judea, to the house of the great God; and it is building with choice stones, and they are laying timbers in the walls, and that work is prospering, and goes on favourably in their hands. 
Then we asked those elders, and thus we said to them, Who gave you the order to build this house, and to provide this preparation? 
And we asked them their names, in order to declare them to you, so as to write to you the names of their leading men. 
And they answered us thus, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are building the house which had been built many years before this, and a great king of Israel built it, and established it for them. 
But after that our fathers provoked the God of heaven, he gave them into the hands of Nabuchodonosor the Chaldean, king of Babylon, and he destroyed this house, and carried the people captive to Babylon. 
And in the first year of king Cyrus, Cyrus the king made a decree that this house of God should be built. 
And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nabuchodonosor brought out from the house that was in Jerusalem, and carried them into the temple of the king, them did king Cyrus bring out from the temple of the king, and gave them to Sabanasar the treasurer, who was over the treasurer; 
and said to him, Take all the vessels, and go, put them in the house that is in Jerusalem in their place. 
Then that Sabanazar came, and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem: and from that time even until now it has been building, and has not been finished. 
And now, if it seem good to the king, lest search be made in the treasure-house of the king at Babylon, that you may know if it be that a decree was made by king Cyrus to build that house of God that was in Jerusalem, and let the king send to us when he has learnt concerning this matter.
