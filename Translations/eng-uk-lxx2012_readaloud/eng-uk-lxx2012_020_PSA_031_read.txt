Psalms.
Chapter 31.
(32) A Psalm of instruction by David. Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, and who sins are covered. 
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin, and whose mouth there is no guile. 
Because I kept silence, my bones waxed old, from my crying all the day. 
For day and night your hand was heavy upon me: I became thoroughly miserable while a thorn was fastened in me. Pause. 
I acknowledged my sin, and hid not mine iniquity: I said, I will confess mine iniquity to the Lord against myself; and you forgave the ungodliness of my heart. Pause. 
Therefore shall every holy one pray to you in a fit time: only in the deluge of many waters they shall not come near to him. 
You are my refuge from the affliction that encompasses me; my joy, to deliver me from them that have compassed me. Pause. 
I will instruct you and guide you in this way wherein you shall go: I will fix mine eyes upon you. 
Be you⌃ not as horse and mule, which have no understanding; but you must constrain their jaws with bit and curb, lest they should come near to you. 
Many are the scourges of the sinner: but him that hopes in the Lord mercy shall compass about. 
Be glad in the Lord, and exult, you⌃ righteous: and glory, all you⌃ that are upright in heart.
