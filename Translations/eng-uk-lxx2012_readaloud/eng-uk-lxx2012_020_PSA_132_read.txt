Psalms.
Chapter 132.
(133) A Song of Degrees. See now! what is so good, or what so pleasant, as for brethren to dwell together? 
It is as ointment on the head, that ran down to the beard, even the beard of Aaron; that ran down to the fringe of his clothing. 
As the dew of Aermon, that comes down on the mountains of Sion: for there, the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for ever.
