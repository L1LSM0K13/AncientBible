Psalms.
Chapter 56.
(57) For the end. Destroy not: by David, for a memorial, when he fled from the presence of Saul to the cave. Have mercy, upon me, O God, have mercy upon me: for my soul has trusted in you: and in the shadow of your wings will I hope, until the iniquity have passed away. 
I will cry to God most high; the God who has benefitted me. Pause. 
He sent from heaven and saved me; he gave to reproach them that trampled on me: God has sent forth his mercy and his truth; 
and he has delivered my soul from the midst of lions'whelps: I lay down to sleep, though troubled. As for the sons of men, their teeth are arms and missile weapons, and their tongue a sharp sword. 
Be you exalted, O God, above the heavens; and your glory above all the earth. 
They have prepared snares for my feet, and have bowed down my soul: they have dug a pit before my face, and fallen into it themselves. Pause. 
My heart, O God, is ready, my heart is ready: I will sing, yes will sing psalms. 
Awake, my glory; awake, lute and harp: I will awake early. 
O Lord, I will give thanks to you amongst the nations: I will sing to you amongst the Gentiles. 
For your mercy has been magnified even to the heavens, and your truth to the clouds. 
Be you exalted, O God, above the heavens; and your glory above all the earth.
