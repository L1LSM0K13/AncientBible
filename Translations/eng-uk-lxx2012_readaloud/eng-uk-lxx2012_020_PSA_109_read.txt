Psalms.
Chapter 109.
(110) A Psalm of David. The Lord said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool. 
The Lord shall send out a rod of power for you out of Sion: rule you in the midst of your enemies. 
With you is dominion in the day of your power, in the splendours of your saints: I have begotten you from the womb before the morning. 
The Lord sware, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec. 
The Lord at your right hand has dashed in pieces kings in the day of his wrath. 
He shall judge amongst the nations, he shall fill up the number of corpses, he shall crush the heads of many on the earth. 
He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall he lift up the head.
