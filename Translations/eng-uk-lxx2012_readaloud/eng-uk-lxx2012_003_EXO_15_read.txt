Exodus.
Chapter 15.
Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to God, and spoke, saying, Let us sing to the Lord, for he is very greatly glorified: horse and rider he has thrown into the sea. 
He was to me a helper and protector for salvation: this is my God and I will glorify him; my father's God, and I will exalt him. 
The Lord bringing wars to nothing, the Lord is his name. 
He has cast the chariots of Pharao and his host into the sea, the chosen mounted captains: they were swallowed up in the Red Sea. 
He covered them with the sea: they sank to the depth like a stone. 
Your right hand, O God, has been glorified in strength; your right hand, O God, has broken the enemies. 
And in the abundance of your glory you have broken the adversaries to pieces: you sent forth your wrath, it devoured them as stubble. 
And by the breath of your anger the water parted asunder; the waters were congealed as a wall, the waves were congealed in the midst of the sea. 
The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoils; I will satisfy my soul, I will destroy with my sword, my hand shall have dominion. 
You sent forth your wind, the sea covered them; they sank like lead in the mighty water. 
Who is like to you amongst the gods, O Lord? who is like to you? glorified in holiness, marvellous in glories, doing wonders. 
You stretched forth your right hand, the earth swallowed them up. 
You have guided in your righteousness this your people whom you have redeemed, by your strength you have called them into your holy resting-place. 
The nations heard and were angry, pangs have seized on the dwellers amongst the Phylistines. 
Then the princes of Edom, and the chiefs of the Moabites hasted; trembling took hold upon them, all the inhabitants of Chanaan melted away. 
Let trembling and fear fall upon them; by the greatness of your arm, let them become as stone; till your people pass over, O Lord, till this your people pass over, whom you have purchased. 
Bring them in and plant them in the mountain of their inheritance, in your prepared habitation, which you, O Lord, have prepared; the sanctuary, O Lord, which your hands have made ready. 
The Lord reigns for ever and ever and ever. 
For the horse of Pharao went in with the chariots and horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought upon them the water of the sea, but the children of Israel walked through dry land in the midst of the sea. 
And Mariam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, having taken a timbrel in her hand—then there went forth all the women after her with timbrels and dances. 
And Mariam led them, saying, Let us sing to the Lord, for he has been very greatly glorified: the horse and rider has he cast into the sea. 
So Moses brought up the children of Israel from the Red Sea, and brought them into the wilderness of Sur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water to drink. 
and they came to Merrha, and could not drink of Merrha, for it was bitter; therefore he named the name of that place, Bitterness. 
And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? 
And Moses cried to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree, and he cast it into the water, and the water was sweetened: there he established to him ordinances and judgements, and there he proved him, 
and said, If you will indeed hear the voice of the Lord your God, and do things pleasing before him, and will listen to his commands, and keep all his ordinances, no disease which I have brought upon the Egyptians will I bring upon you, for I am the Lord your God that heals you. 
And they came to Aelim, and there were there twelve fountains of water, and seventy stems of palm-trees; and they encamped there by the waters.
