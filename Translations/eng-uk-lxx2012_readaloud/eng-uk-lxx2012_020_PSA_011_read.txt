Psalms.
Chapter 11.
(12) For the end, A Psalm of David, upon the eighth. Save me, O Lord; for the godly man has failed; for truth is diminished from amongst the children of men. 
Every one has spoken vanity to his neighbour: their lips are deceitful, they have spoken with a double heart. 
Let the Lord destroy all the deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaks great words: 
who have said, We will magnify our tongue; our lips are our own: who is Lord of us? 
Because of the misery of the poor, and because of the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, says the Lord, I will set them in safety; I will speak to them thereof openly. 
The oracles of the Lord are pure oracles; as silver tried in the fire, proved in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. 
You, O Lord, shall keep us, and shall preserve us, from this generation, and for ever. 
The ungodly walk around: according to your greatness you have greatly exalted the sons of men.
