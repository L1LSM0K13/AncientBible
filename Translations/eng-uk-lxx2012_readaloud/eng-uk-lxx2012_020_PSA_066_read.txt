Psalms.
Chapter 66.
(67) For the end, a Psalm of David amongst the Hymns. God be merciful to us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us. Pause. 
That men may know your way on the earth, your salvation amongst all nations. 
Let the nations, O God, give thanks to you; let all the nations give thanks to you. 
Let the nations rejoice and exult, for you shall judge the peoples in equity, and shall guide the nations on the earth. Pause. 
Let the peoples, O God, give thanks to you; let all the peoples give thanks to you. 
The earth has yielded her fruit; let God, our God bless us. 
Let God bless us; and let all the ends of the earth fear him.
