Psalms.
Chapter 119.
(120) A Song of Degrees. In mine affliction I cried to the Lord, and he listened to me. 
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from unjust lips, and from a deceitful tongue. 
What should be given to you, and what should be added to you, for your crafty tongue? 
Sharpened weapons of the mighty, with coals of the desert. 
Woe is me, that my sojourning is prolonged; I have tabernacled amongst the tents of Kedar. 
My soul has long been a sojourner; 
I was peaceful amongst them that hated peace; when I spoke to them, they warred against me without a cause.
