Psalms.
Chapter 40.
(41) For the end, a Psalm of David. Blessed is the man who thinks, on the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him in an evil day. 
May the Lord preserve him and keep him alive, and bless him on the earth, and not deliver him into the hands of his enemy. 
May the Lord help him upon the bed of his pain; you have made all his bed in his sickness. 
I said, O Lord, have mercy upon me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against you. 
Mine enemies have spoken evil against me, saying, When shall he die, and his name perish? 
And if he came to see me, his heart spoke vainly; he gathered iniquity to himself; he went forth and spoke in like manner. 
All my enemies whispered against me; against me they devised my hurt. 
They denounced a wicked word against me, saying, Now that he lies, shall he not rise up again? 
For even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, lifted up his heel against me. 
But you, O Lord, have compassion upon me, and raise me up, and I shall requite them. 
By this I know that you have delighted in me, because mine enemy shall not rejoice over me. 
But you did help me because of mine innocence, and have established me before you for ever. 
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. So be it, so be it.
