Esias.
Chapter 50.
Thus says the Lord, Of what kind is your mother's bill of divorcement, by which I put her away? or to which debtor have I sold you? Behold, you⌃ are sold for your sins, and for your iniquities have I put your mother away. 
Why did I come, and there was no man? why did I call, and there was none to listen? Is not my hand strong to redeem? or can I not deliver? behold, by my rebuke I will dry up the sea, and make rivers a wilderness; and their fish shall be dried up because there is no water, and shall die for thirst. 
I will clothe the sky with darkness, and will make its covering as sackcloth. 
The Lord even God gives me the tongue of instruction, to know when it is fit to speak a word: he has appointed for me early, he has given me an ear to hear: 
and the instruction of the Lord, even the Lord, opens mine ears, and I do not disobey, nor dispute. 
I gave my back to scourges, and my cheeks to blows; and I turned not away my face from the shame of spitting: 
but the Lord God became my helper; therefore I was not ashamed, but I set my face as a solid rock; and I know that I shall never be ashamed, 
for he that has justified me draws near; who is he that pleads with me? let him stand up against me at the same time: yes, who is he that pleads with me? let him draw near to me. 
Behold, the Lord, the Lord, will help me; who will hurt me? behold, all you⌃ shall wax old as a garment, and a moth shall devour you. 
Who is amongst you that fears the Lord? let him listen to the voice of his servant: you⌃ that walk in darkness, and have no light, trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon God. 
Behold, you⌃ all kindle a fire, and feed a flame: walk in the light of your fire, and in the flame which you⌃ have kindled. This has happened to you for my sake; you⌃ shall lie down in sorrow.
