Deuteronomy.
Chapter 34.
And Moses went up from Araboth Moab to the mount of Nabau, to the top of Phasga, which is before Jericho; and the Lord showed him all the mount of Galaad to Dan, and all the land of Nephthali, 
and all the land of Ephraim and Manasse, and all the land of Juda to the farthest sea; 
and the wilderness, and the country round about Jericho, the city of palm-trees, to Segor. 
And the Lord said to Moses, This is the land of which I sware to Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob, saying, To your seed will I give it: and I have showed it to your eyes, but you shall not go in there. 
So Moses the servant of the Lord died in the land of Moab by the word of the Lord. 
And they buried him in Gai near the house of Phogor; and no one has seen his sepulchre to this day. 
And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old at his death; his eyes were not dimmed, nor were his natural powers destroyed. 
And the children of Israel wept for Moses in Araboth of Moab at Jordan near Jericho thirty days; and the days of the sad mourning for Moses were completed. 
And Joshua the son of Naue was filled with the spirit of knowledge, for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel listened to him; and they did as the Lord commanded Moses. 
And there rose up no more a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, 
in all the signs and wonders, which the Lord sent him to work in Egypt on Pharao, and his servants, and all his land; 
the great wonders, and the mighty hand which Moses displayed before all Israel.
