Psalms.
Chapter 121.
(122) A Song of Degrees. I was glad when they said to me, Let us go into the house of the Lord. 
Our feet stood in your courts, O Jerusalem. 
Jerusalem is built as a city whose fellowship is complete. 
For there the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord. 
For there are set thrones for judgement, even thrones for the house of David. 
Pray now for the peace of Jerusalem: and let there be prosperity to them that love you. 
Let peace, I pray, be within your host, and prosperity in your palaces. 
For the sake of my brethren and my neighbours, I have indeed spoken peace concerning you. 
Because of the house of the Lord our God, I have diligently sought your good.
