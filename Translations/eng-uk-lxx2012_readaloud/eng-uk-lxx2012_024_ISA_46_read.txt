Esias.
Chapter 46.
Bel has fallen, Nabo is broken to pieces, their graven images are gone to the wild beasts and the cattle: you⌃ take them packed up as a burden to the weary, exhausted, hungry, and at the same time helpless man; 
who will not be able to save themselves from war, but they themselves are led away captive. 
Hear me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of Israel, who are borne by me from the womb, and taught by me from infancy, even to old age: 
I am he; and until you⌃ shall have grown old, I am he: I bear you, I have made, and I will relieve, I will take up and save you. 
To whom have you⌃ compared me? see, consider, you⌃ that go astray. 
They that furnish gold out of a purse, and silver by weight, will weigh it in a scale, and they hire a goldsmith and make idols, and bow down, and worship them. 
They bear it upon the shoulder, and go; and if they put it upon its place, it remains, it can’t move: and whoever shall cry to it, it can’t hear; it can’t save him from trouble. 
Remember you⌃ these things, and groan: repent, you⌃ that have gone astray, return in your heart; 
and remember the former things that were of old: for I am God, and there is none other beside me, 
telling beforehand the latter events before they come to pass, and they are accomplished together: and I said, all my counsel shall stand, and I will do all things that I have planned: 
calling a bird from the east, and from a land afar off, for the things which I have planned: I have spoken, and brought him; I have created and made him; I have brought him, and prospered his way. 
Listen to me, you⌃ senseless ones, that are far from righteousness: 
I have brought near my righteousness, and I will not be slow with the salvation that is from me: I have given salvation in Sion to Israel for glory.
