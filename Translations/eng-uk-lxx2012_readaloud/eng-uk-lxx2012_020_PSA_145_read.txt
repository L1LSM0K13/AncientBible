Psalms.
Chapter 145.
(146) Alleluia, a Psalm of Aggaeus and Zacharias. My soul, praise the Lord. 
While I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist. 
Trust not in princes, nor in the children of men, in whom there is no safety. 
His breath shall go forth, and he shall return to his earth; in that day all his thoughts shall perish. 
Blessed is he whose helper is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God: 
who made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all things in them: who keeps truth for ever: 
who executes judgement for the wronged: who gives food to the hungry. The Lord looses the fettered ones: 
the Lord gives wisdom to the blind: The Lord sets up the broken down: the Lord loves the righteous: the Lord preserves the strangers; 
he will relieve the orphan and widow: but will utterly remove the way of sinners. 
The Lord shall reign for ever, even your God, O Sion, to all generations.
