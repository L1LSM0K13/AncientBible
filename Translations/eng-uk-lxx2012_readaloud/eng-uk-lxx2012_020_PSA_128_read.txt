Psalms.
Chapter 128.
A Song of Degrees. Many a time have they warred against me from my youth, let Israel now say: 
Many a time have they warred against me from my youth: and yet they prevailed not against me. 
The sinners wrought upon my back: they prolonged their iniquity. 
The righteous Lord has cut asunder the necks of sinners. 
Let all that hate Sion be put to shame and turned back. 
Let them be as the grass of the housetops, which withers before it is plucked up. 
Wherewith the reaper fills not his hand, nor he that makes up the sheaves, his bosom. 
Neither do they that go by say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you: we have blessed you in the name of the Lord.
