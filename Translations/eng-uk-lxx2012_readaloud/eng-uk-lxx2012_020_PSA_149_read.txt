Psalms.
Chapter 149.
Alleluia. Sing to the Lord a new song: his praise is in the assembly of the saints. 
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him; and let the children of Sion exult in their king. 
Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sings praises to him with timbrel and lute. 
For the Lord takes pleasure in his people; and will exalt the meek with salvation. 
The saints shall rejoice in glory; and shall exult on their beds. 
The high praises of God shall be in their throat, and two-edged swords in their hands; 
to execute vengeance on the nations, and punishments amongst the peoples; 
to bind their kings with fetters, and their nobles with manacles of iron; to execute on them the judgement written: this honour have all his saints.
