Psalms.
Chapter 107.
(108) Song of a Psalm by David. O God, my heart is ready, my heart is ready; I will sing and sing psalms with my glory. 
Awake, lute and harp; I will awake early. 
I will give thanks to you, O Lord, amongst the people; I will sing praise to you amongst the Gentiles. 
For your mercy is great above the heavens, and your truth reaches to the clouds. 
Be you exalted, O God, above the heavens; and your glory above all the earth. 
That your beloved ones may be delivered, save with your right hand, and hear me. God has spoken in his sanctuary; 
I will be exalted, and will divide Sicima, and will measure out the valley of tents. 
Galaad is mine; and Manasses is mine; and Ephraim is the help of mine head; Judas is my king; 
Moab is the cauldron of my hope; over Idumea will I cast my sandal; the Philistines are made subject to me. 
Who will bring me into the fortified city? or who will guide me to Idumea? 
Will not you, O God, who have rejected us? and will not you, O God, go forth with our hosts? 
Give us help from tribulation: for vain is the help of man. 
Through God we shall do valiantly; and he will bring to nothing our enemies.
