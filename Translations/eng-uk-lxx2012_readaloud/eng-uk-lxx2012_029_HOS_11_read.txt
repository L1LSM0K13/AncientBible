Osee.
Chapter 11.
Early in the morning were they cast off, the king of Israel has been cast off: for Israel is a child, and I loved him, and out of Egypt have I called his children. 
As I called them, so they departed from my presence: they sacrificed to Baalim, and burnt incense to graven images. 
Yet I bound the feet of Ephraim, I took him on my arm; but they knew not that I healed them. 
When men were destroyed, I drew them with the bands of my love: and I will be to them as a man striking another on his cheek: and I will have respect to him, I will prevail with him. 
Ephraim lived in Egypt; and as for the Assyrian, he was his king, because he would not return. 
And in his cities he prevailed not with the sword, and he ceased to war with his hands: and they shall eat of the fruit of their own devices: 
and his people shall cleave fondly to their habitation; but God shall be angry with his precious things, and shall not at all exalt him. 
How shall I deal with you, Ephraim? how shall I protect you, Israel? what shall I do with you? I will make you as Adama, and as Seboim; my heart is turned at once, my repentance is powerfully excited. 
I will not act according to the fury of my wrath, I will not abandon Ephraim to be utterly destroyed: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One within you: and I will not enter into the city. 
I will go after the Lord: he shall utter his voice as a lion: for he shall roar, and the children of the waters shall be amazed. 
They shall be amazed and fly as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of the Assyrians: and I will restore them to their houses, says the Lord. 
Ephraim has compassed me with falsehood, and the house of Israel and Juda with ungodliness: but now God knows them, and they shall be called God's holy people.
