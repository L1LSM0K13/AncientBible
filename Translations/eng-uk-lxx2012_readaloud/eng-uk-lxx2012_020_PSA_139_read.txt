Psalms.
Chapter 139.
(140) For the end, a Psalm of David. Rescue me, O Lord, from the evil man; deliver me from the unjust man. 
Who have devised injustice in their hearts; all the day they prepared war. 
They have sharpened their tongue as the tongue of a serpent; the poison of asps is under their lips. Pause. 
Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the sinner; rescue me from unjust men; who have purposed to overthrow my goings. 
The proud have hid a snare for me, and have stretched out ropes for snares for my feet; they set a stumbling block for me near the path. Pause. 
I said to the Lord, You are my God; listen, O Lord, to the voice of my supplication. 
O Lord God, the strength of my salvation; you have screened my head in the day of battle. 
Deliver me not, O Lord, to the sinner, according to my desire: they have devised mischief against me; forsake me not, lest they should be exalted. Pause. 
As for the head of them that compass me, the mischief of their lips shall cover them. 
Coals of fire shall fall upon them on the earth; and you shall cast them down in afflictions: they shall not bear up under them. 
A talkative man shall not prosper on the earth: evils shall hunt the unrighteous man to destruction. 
I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the poor, and the right of the needy ones. 
Surely the righteous shall give thanks to your name: the upright shall dwell in your presence.
