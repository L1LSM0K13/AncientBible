1 Corinthians.
Chapter 8.
Now concerning food sacrificed to idols, we know that “we all have knowledge.” Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. 
If anyone thinks he knows something, he has not yet come to know anything as he ought to know it. 
But if anyone loves God, he is known by God. 
With regard then to eating food sacrificed to idols, we know that “an idol is nothing in the world,” and that “there is no other God but one.” 
For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”), 
for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we exist for him; and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we exist through him. 
However, not everyone possesses this knowledge. But some have idols in their conscience even now and eat such food as something sacrificed to idols, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. 
But food does not bring us close to God. For we are no better off if we eat, and no worse off if we do not eat. 
But be careful that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. 
For if someone sees yoʋ, who have knowledge, reclining for a meal in the temple of an idol, will not his weak conscience be emboldened to eat food sacrificed to idols? 
Should the weak brother, for whose sake Christ died, perish because of yoʋr knowledge? 
When you sin in this way against your brothers and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. 
Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will certainly never eat meat, so that I will not cause my brother to stumble.
