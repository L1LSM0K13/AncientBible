Hebrews.
Chapter 12.
Therefore, since we have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that lies before us, 
fixing our eyes upon Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 
Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners against himself, so that you will not grow weary or lose heart. 
In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 
And you have completely forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons: “My son, do not think lightly of the discipline of the Lord, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you. 
For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he punishes every son he receives.” 
For the sake of discipline you must endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father? 
If you do not experience discipline, which is something everyone receives, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. 
Furthermore, we have all had earthly fathers who disciplined us, and we respected them. Should we not submit even more to the Father of spirits and live? 
For our fathers disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but God disciplines us for our good, so that we may share in his holiness. 
Now no discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces the peaceful fruit of righteousness for those trained by it. 
Therefore, lift up your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees. 
Make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but healed instead. 
Pursue peace with everyone, and holiness, for without it no one will see the Lord. 
See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble, which would result in many becoming defiled. 
See to it that there is no fornicator or profane person like Esau, who sold his birthright in exchange for a single meal. 
You know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no opportunity for repentance, even though he sought the blessing with tears. 
For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched, to a blazing fire, darkness, gloom, and a whirlwind. 
You have not come to a trumpet blast and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further word be spoken to them. 
For they could not bear the order that was given: “If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.” 
Indeed, the sight was so terrifying that Moses said, “I am trembling with fear.” 
But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to myriads of angels, 
to the festive gathering and assembly of the firstborn, whose names are enrolled in heaven. You have come to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous people who have been made perfect. 
And you have come to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel. 
See to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For if the people did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, how much less will we escape if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven? 
At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens.” 
Now the phrase, “Yet once more,” indicates the removal of what can be shaken—that is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain. 
Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful. It is by our thankfulness that we offer God acceptable worship, with reverence and godly fear. 
For our God is a consuming fire.
