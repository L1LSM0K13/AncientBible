The Second Letter of Paul to the Thessalonians.
Chapter 1.
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers, as is only fitting, because your faith is greatly increasing and the love that every one of you has for one another is abounding. 
As a result we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your perseverance and faithfulness in all the persecutions and tribulations that you are enduring. 
This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, and it is happening so that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are suffering. 
It is indeed right for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you, 
and to give to you who are being afflicted relief along with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels. 
With flaming fire he will inflict vengeance on those who do not know God and who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 
They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, separated from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might, 
on that day when he comes to be glorified by his saints and to be marveled at by all who have believed, including you, because you have believed our testimony. 
With this in mind, we always pray for you that our God will make you worthy of his calling and by his power bring to fulfillment every good intention and work of faith, 
so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ.
