Galatians.
Chapter 6.
Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness, paying attention to yoʋrself so that yoʋ too are not tempted. 
Bear one another's burdens, and in this way fulfill the law of Christ. 
For if anyone thinks that he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 
But each person should test his own work, and then he will have reason for boasting in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another. 
For each person will bear his own load. 
Now the one who is instructed in the word must share all good things with the one who instructs him. 
Do not be misled: God is not mocked. A person reaps what he sows. 
For he who sows to his own flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but he who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit. 
So let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due time we will reap, if we do not give up. 
Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, and especially to those of the household of faith. 
See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand. 
It is those who want to make a good appearance in the flesh who compel you to be circumcised, but only so that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. 
For not even those who are circumcised keep the law, but they want you to be circumcised so that they can boast about your flesh. 
But as for me, may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 
For in Christ Jesus neither does circumcision have any significance, nor uncircumcision, but what matters is whether we become a new creation. 
As for all who follow this standard, peace and mercy be upon them and upon the Israel of God. 
From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus on my body. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
