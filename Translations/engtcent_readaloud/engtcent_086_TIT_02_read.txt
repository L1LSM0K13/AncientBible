Titus.
Chapter 2.
But as for yoʋ, teach what is consistent with sound doctrine. 
Elderly men are to be sober-minded, dignified, sensible, and sound in faith, love, and endurance. 
Elderly women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderous or enslaved to much wine, but teaching what is good, 
so that they can admonish the young women to be loving to their husbands, loving to their children, 
sensible, pure, homemakers, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be discredited. 
In the same way, urge the younger men to be of sound mind. 
Show yoʋrself to be a model of good works in every way, and in yoʋr teaching show integrity, dignity, incorruptibility, 
and sound speech that is above reproach, so that any opponent may be put to shame because he has nothing bad to say about us. 
Slaves are to be submissive to their own masters and well-pleasing in everything, not talking back, 
not pilfering, but showing all good faith, so that in every way they may adorn the teaching of God our Savior. 
For the saving grace of God has appeared to all people, 
instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts and to live in a sensible, righteous, and godly manner in the present age, 
as we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. 
He gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works. 
Declare these things; encourage and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise yoʋ.
