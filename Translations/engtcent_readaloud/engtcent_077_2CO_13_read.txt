2 Corinthians.
Chapter 13.
This is the third time I am coming to you. Every matter must be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses. 
I gave a warning when I was present the second time, and now I am giving this written warning while absent: If I come again I will not spare those who sinned previously or any of the others, 
since you seek proof that Christ is speaking in me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you. 
For though he was crucified in weakness, he lives by the power of God. Now we also are weak in him, but in dealing with you we will live with him by the power of God. 
Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith; test yourselves. Or do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless, of course, you fail to meet the test. 
But I hope you will recognize that we have not failed the test. 
I pray to God that you will not do anything wrong—not so that we may appear to have met the test, but so that you may do what is right, even though we may appear to have failed. 
For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth. 
We rejoice when we are weak and you are strong, and we pray for your restoration. 
The reason I am writing these things to you while I am absent is so that, when I am present, I will not need to be harsh in my use of authority, which the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down. 
Finally, brothers, rejoice. Be restored, be comforted, be of the same mind, and live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you. 
Greet one another with a holy kiss. 
All the saints greet you. 
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
