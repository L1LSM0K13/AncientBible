Titus.
Chapter 3.
Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, 
to slander no one, and to be peaceable and considerate, always showing gentleness toward everyone. 
For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, and enslaved to various lusts and pleasures. Living in wickedness and envy, we were loathsome and hated one another. 
But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared, 
he saved us, not because of any righteous works we had done, but according to his mercy, through the washing of regeneration and the renewal of the Holy Spirit. 
He richly poured out his Spirit upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 
This saying is trustworthy. I want yoʋ to insist on these things, so that those who have put their trust in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works. These things are good and beneficial for people. 
But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, quarrels, and disputes about the law, for they are unprofitable and futile. 
Reject a divisive person after a first and second warning. 
For yoʋ know that such a person is corrupted and sinful; he is self-condemned. 
When I send Artemas to yoʋ, or Tychicus, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. 
Do everything yoʋ can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way, and see to it that they lack nothing. 
Our people must learn to devote themselves to good works in order to meet pressing needs, so that they will not be unfruitful. 
All who are with me greet yoʋ. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
