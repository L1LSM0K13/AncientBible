Matthew.
Chapter 27.
Now when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. 
They bound him, led him away, and handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor. 
When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned, he regretted what he had done and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, 
saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” But they said, “What is that to us? See to it yoʋrself.” 
So he threw the pieces of silver into the temple and departed. Then he went away and hanged himself. 
The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, “It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since they are a price paid for blood.” 
So they took counsel and used the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. 
Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. 
Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set, on whom some of the sons of Israel had set a price, 
and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.” 
Meanwhile, Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are yoʋ the king of the Jews?” Jesus said to him, “Yoʋ have said it yoʋrself.” 
But when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he made no answer. 
Then Pilate said to him, “Do yoʋ not hear all the things they are testifying against yoʋ?” 
But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so the governor was greatly amazed. 
Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner for the crowd, whomever they wanted. 
At that time they had a notorious prisoner named Barabbas. 
So when the crowds were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?” 
(For he knew they had handed Jesus over out of envy.) 
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him this message: “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.” 
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas to be released and for Jesus to be executed. 
In response the governor said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” They said, “Barabbas.” 
So Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ?” They all said to him, “Let him be crucified!” 
Then the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?” But they cried out all the more, “Let him be crucified!” 
When Pilate saw that he was achieving nothing and that a riot was breaking out, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man. See to it yourselves.” 
All the people answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!” 
Then he released for them Barabbas, but he scourged Jesus and handed him over to be crucified. 
Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus with them into the governor's headquarters and gathered against him the entire cohort of soldiers. 
They stripped him, put a scarlet robe on him, 
twisted together a crown of thorns, and put it on his head. They put a reed in his right hand, and kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 
Then they spit on him, took the reed, and beat him repeatedly on his head. 
When they had finished mocking him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own garments back on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. 
As they went out, they found a Cyrenian man named Simon. They pressed him into service, forcing him to carry Jesus' cross. 
When they came to a place called Golgotha (which means, “Place of the Skull”), 
they gave Jesus sour wine to drink mixed with gall. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink it. 
After crucifying him, they divided his garments among themselves by casting lots. 
Then they sat down and kept watch over him there. 
Over his head they placed the written charge against him, which read, “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.” 
Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. 
Those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads 
and saying, “Yoʋ who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yoʋrself. If yoʋ are the Son of God, come down from the cross!” 
In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes, elders, and Pharisees, were mocking him, saying, 
“He saved others, but he cannot save himself. If he is the king of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. 
He has put his trust in God; let God deliver him now if he wants him, for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’ ” 
The robbers who were crucified with him were also reviling him in the same way. 
From the sixth hour until the ninth hour, there was darkness over the whole land. 
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why have yoʋ forsaken me?” 
When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “This man is calling for Elijah.” 
Immediately one of them ran, got a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink. 
But the rest said, “Leave him alone. Let us see if Elijah comes to save him.” 
Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit. 
And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth was shaken, and the rocks were split. 
The tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised. 
(They came out of the tombs, and after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many.) 
Now when the centurion and those who were keeping watch with him over Jesus saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they became very frightened and said, “Truly this man was the Son of God.” 
Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee and provided for him were there looking on from a distance, 
among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. 
When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who was himself also a disciple of Jesus. 
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. So Pilate commanded that the body be given to him. 
Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 
and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. Then he rolled a large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away. 
Mary Magdalene was there, and so was the other Mary, sitting across from the tomb. 
The next day (that is, after the day of Preparation), the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together before Pilate 
and said, “Sir, we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ 
Therefore command that the tomb be secured until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, steal him away, and say to the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead.’ This last deception would be worse than the first.” 
Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of soldiers. Go and make it as secure as you know how.” 
So they went and secured the tomb by sealing the stone and posting the guard of soldiers.
