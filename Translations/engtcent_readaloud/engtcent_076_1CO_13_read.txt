1 Corinthians.
Chapter 13.
If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 
If I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 
If I give away all my possessions to feed others, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but do not have love, I receive no benefit. 
Love is patient and kind. Love does not envy or boast. It is not puffed up 
or rude. It does not seek its own way, it is not irritable, and it keeps no record of wrongs. 
It does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth. 
It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things. 
Love never fails. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will come to an end. 
Now we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 
Yet when the perfect comes, the partial will come to an end. 
When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, and I reasoned like a child. But when I became a man, I set aside childish ways. 
For now we see in a mirror by means of an obscure image, but then we will see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I have been fully known. 
And now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
