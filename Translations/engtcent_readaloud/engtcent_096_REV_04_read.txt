Revelation.
Chapter 4.
After this I looked, and behold, a door was standing open in heaven! And the voice I had previously heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, “Come up here, and I will show yoʋ what must take place after this.” 
Immediately I was in the Spirit, and behold, there was a throne in heaven, with one sitting on the throne, 
like jasper and carnelian in appearance. And around the throne was a rainbow that looked like an emerald. 
Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and sitting on the thrones were the twenty-four elders. They were clothed in white garments and had golden crowns on their heads. 
From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder, and there were seven flaming torches burning before the throne; these are the seven spirits of God. 
Also before the throne was something like a sea of glass that looked like crystal. Around the throne on each side were four living creatures, full of eyes in front and in back. 
The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like a calf, the third living creature had the face of a man, and the fourth living creature was like an eagle in flight. 
Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around and within. Day and night they never stop saying, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.” 
And whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, 
the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne and say, 
“Yoʋ are worthy, our Lord and God, the Holy One, to receive glory, honor, and power, for yoʋ created all things, and by yoʋr will they came into existence and were created.”
