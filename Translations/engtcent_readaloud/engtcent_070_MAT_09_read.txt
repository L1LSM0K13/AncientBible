Matthew.
Chapter 9.
After getting into the boat, Jesus went back across the sea and came to his own city. 
And behold, some men brought to him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Take courage, son; yoʋr sins are forgiven yoʋ.” 
And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming.” 
Perceiving their thoughts, Jesus said, “Why are you thinking evil things in your hearts? 
Which is easier, to say, ‘Yoʋr sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’? 
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—then he said to the paralytic—“Rise, pick up yoʋr bed, and go to yoʋr house.” 
So he rose and went to his house. 
When the crowds saw it, they were amazed and glorified God, who had given such authority to men. 
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax booth. Jesus said to him, “Follow me,” so Matthew rose and followed him. 
Later, as Jesus reclined at the table in Matthew's house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined with him and his disciples. 
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why is your teacher eating with tax collectors and sinners?” 
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, “It is not the healthy who have need of a physician, but the sick. 
Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” 
Then the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, “Why do we and the Pharisees often fast, but yoʋr disciples do not fast?” 
Jesus said to them, “Can the bridegroom's attendants mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days are coming when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast. 
No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made. 
Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins burst, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are destroyed. But new wine is put into new wineskins, and both are preserved.” 
As he said these things to them, behold, a ruler came and bowed down before him, saying, “My daughter has just now died, but come and lay yoʋr hand on her, and she will live.” 
So Jesus rose and followed him, and so did his disciples. 
And behold, a woman who had suffered from a flow of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment. 
For she said to herself, “If only I touch his garment, I will be healed.” 
But when Jesus turned around and saw her, he said, “Take courage, daughter; yoʋr faith has healed yoʋ.” And the woman was healed from that hour. 
When Jesus came to the house of the ruler and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion, 
he said to them, “Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping.” And they began laughing at him. 
But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took hold of the girl's hand, and she arose. 
And news of this spread throughout that entire region. 
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, crying out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!” 
When he went into the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord.” 
Then he touched their eyes, saying, “Let it be done for yoʋ according to your faith.” 
And their eyes were opened. Then Jesus sternly warned them, “See that no one knows about this.” 
But they went out and spread the news about him throughout that entire region. 
As they were going away, behold, a mute man possessed by a demon was brought to Jesus. 
When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke, and the crowds were amazed, saying, “Such a thing has never been seen in Israel.” 
But the Pharisees said, “By the ruler of demons he casts out demons.” 
Then Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people. 
When he saw the crowds, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 
Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. 
Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”
