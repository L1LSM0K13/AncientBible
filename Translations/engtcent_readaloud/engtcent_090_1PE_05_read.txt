1 Peter.
Chapter 5.
I exhort the elders among you, I who am a fellow elder, a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker in the glory that will be revealed: 
Shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly; not for sordid gain, but eagerly. 
Do not lord it over those entrusted to you, but be examples to the flock. 
And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. 
In the same way, you who are younger must submit to your elders. And all of you must clothe yourselves with humility as you submit to one another, for “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” 
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in due time, 
casting all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you. 
Be sober-minded and watchful; your adversary the devil walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. 
Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are enduring the same kinds of suffering. 
And after you have suffered for a little while, may the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, himself perfect you; he will establish, strengthen, and settle you. 
To him be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen. 
Through Silvanus, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand. 
She who is in Babylon, who is chosen together with you, greets you, and so does my son Mark. 
Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
