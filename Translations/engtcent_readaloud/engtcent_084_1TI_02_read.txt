1 Timothy.
Chapter 2.
I urge then, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, 
for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and dignity. 
For this is good and acceptable before God our Savior, 
who wants all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 
who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time. 
For this testimony I was appointed to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. (I am speaking the truth in Christ; I am not lying.) 
Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or argument. 
Likewise, I want the women to adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and discretion, not with elaborately braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing, 
but with good works, which is proper for women who profess godly reverence. 
A woman should learn quietly with full submission. 
I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. 
For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 
And Adam was not the one who was deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and fell into transgression. 
Nevertheless, women will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.
