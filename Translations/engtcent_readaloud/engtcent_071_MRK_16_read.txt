Mark.
Chapter 16.
When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint Jesus' body. 
Very early in the morning of the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb. 
On the way, they were saying to one another, “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb for us?” 
But when they arrived, they looked up and saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled away. 
As they went into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white robe, and they were alarmed. 
But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen; he is not here. Behold, this is the place where they laid him. 
And now go tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.” 
So they went out and fled from the tomb, and trembling and amazement seized them. But they did not say anything to anyone, for they were afraid. 
In the morning on the first day of the week, after Jesus had risen, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. 
She then went and told those who had been with him, while they were mourning and weeping. 
But when they heard that he was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it. 
After this, Jesus appeared in a different form to two of his followers as they were walking along in the countryside. 
They went back and told the others, but they did not believe them either. 
Later Jesus appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen him after he had risen. 
He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. 
Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 
And these signs will accompany those who believe: They will cast out demons in my name, they will speak in new tongues, 
they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly poison, it will certainly not harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well.” 
After the Lord had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. 
Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked through them and confirmed the message by the signs that accompanied it. Amen.
