1 Corinthians.
Chapter 5.
It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, a kind of fornication that is not even named among the Gentiles, for a man has his father's wife. 
And you are puffed up! You should have mourned instead and removed the man who did this from among you. 
For though I am absent in body, I am present in spirit. And I have already judged the man who did this, just as though I were present. 
So when you are gathered together in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and I am with you in spirit, along with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? 
Purge out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump of dough, since you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed for us. 
So then, let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 
I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with fornicators. 
Yet I certainly did not mean the fornicators of this world or the greedy or swindlers or idolaters, since you would then need to go out of the world. 
But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who is named as a brother if he is a fornicator or greedy, an idolater or a reviler, a drunkard or a swindler; do not even eat with such a man. 
For what have I to do with judging those who are outside the church? Do you not judge those who are inside the church? 
God will judge those who are outside the church. “Therefore you must remove the evil person from among you.”
