The Letter to the Hebrews.
Chapter 1.
God spoke to our fathers long ago at many times and in many ways through the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us through his Son, 
whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe. 
He is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his nature, sustaining all things by his powerful word. When he had made purification for our sins by giving his own life, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in high places, 
having become as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs. 
For to which of the angels did God ever say, “Yoʋ are my Son; today I have begotten yoʋ”? Or again, “I will be his Father, and he will be my Son”? 
And again, when he brings his firstborn into the world, he says, “Let all the angels of God worship him.” 
Of the angels he says, “He makes his angels winds, and his servants a flame of fire,” 
but of the Son he says, “Yoʋr throne, O God, endures forever and ever; the scepter of yoʋr kingdom is a scepter of uprightness. 
Yoʋ have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, yoʋr God, has anointed yoʋ with the oil of gladness beyond yoʋr companions.” 
And, “In the beginning yoʋ, O Lord, laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of yoʋr hands. 
They will perish, but yoʋ remain; they will all wear out like a garment. 
Yoʋ will roll them up like a robe, and they will be changed. But yoʋ are the same, and yoʋr years will have no end.” 
To which of the angels did God ever say, “Sit at my right hand until I make yoʋr enemies a footstool for yoʋr feet”? 
Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve those who will inherit salvation?
