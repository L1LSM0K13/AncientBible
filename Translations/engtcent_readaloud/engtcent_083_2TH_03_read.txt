2 Thessalonians.
Chapter 3.
Finally, brothers, pray for us that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, just as it was with you. 
And pray that we may be rescued from deviant and evil men, for not all have faith. 
But the Lord is faithful; he will establish you and guard you from the evil one. 
We have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will continue to do what we command you. 
May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and the steadfastness of Christ. 
Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep yourselves away from every brother who walks in idleness and does not live according to the teaching we passed on to them. 
For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not idle when we were with you, 
nor did we eat bread from anyone free of charge. On the contrary, with labor and hardship we worked day and night so as not to be a burden to any of you. 
We did this, not because we do not have the right to be supported, but to present ourselves as an example for you to imitate. 
For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: “If anyone is not willing to work, neither should he eat.” 
For we hear that some among you are walking in idleness, not working at all, but being busybodies. 
Now we command and exhort such people by our Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and eat their own bread. 
But as for you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good. 
If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of him and do not associate with him, so that he will feel ashamed. 
Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. 
Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with you all. 
I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. This is the distinguishing mark in all my letters; it is the way I write. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
