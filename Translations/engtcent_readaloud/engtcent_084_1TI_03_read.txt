1 Timothy.
Chapter 3.
This saying is trustworthy: If anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a good work. 
Therefore the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, sensible, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 
not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for sordid gain, but gentle, not contentious, and not a lover of money. 
He must lead his own household well, keeping his children in submission with all dignity. 
(For if a man does not know how to lead his own household, how will he take care of God's church?) 
He must not be a new convert, or he might become puffed up and fall into the condemnation of the devil. 
He must also have a good reputation among outsiders, so that he may not fall into the reproach and snare of the devil. 
Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, and not greedy for sordid gain. 
They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. 
They must first be tested; if they are above reproach, let them serve as deacons. 
Their wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober-minded and faithful in all things. 
A deacon must be the husband of one wife and must lead his children and his own household well. 
For those who have served well as deacons obtain a good standing for themselves along with great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. 
I am writing these things to yoʋ, hoping to come to yoʋ soon. 
But if I delay, I am writing so that yoʋ may know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and foundation of the truth. 
Beyond all question, great is the mystery of godliness: God was revealed in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among nations, believed on in the world, and taken up in glory.
