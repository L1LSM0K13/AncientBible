Hebrews.
Chapter 3.
Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus Christ, the apostle and high priest of our confession, 
who was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house. 
Yet Jesus is considered worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself. 
For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. 
Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, which provided testimony to what would be spoken later. 
But Christ is faithful over God's house as a Son. And we are his house if indeed we hold our confidence firm to the end along with the hope in which we boast. 
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, “Today, if you hear his voice, 
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness, 
where your fathers tried me, tested me, and saw my works for forty years. 
Therefore I was angry with that generation and said, ‘They always go astray in their hearts; they have not known my ways.’ 
As I swore in my wrath, ‘They will not enter my rest!’ ” 
See to it, brothers, that none of you has an evil heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God. 
But encourage one another each day, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. 
For we have become sharers in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end. 
As it is said, “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.” 
For some did rebel when they heard God's voice, but not all whom Moses led out of Egypt. 
Now with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? 
And to whom did God swear that they would not enter his rest, if not to those who were disobedient? 
So we see that it was because of their unbelief that they were not able to enter.
