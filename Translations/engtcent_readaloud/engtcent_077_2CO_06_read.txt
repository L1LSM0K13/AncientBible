2 Corinthians.
Chapter 6.
As God's fellow workers, we urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain. 
For he says, “At a favorable time I listened to yoʋ, and in a day of salvation I helped yoʋ.” Behold, now is the favorable time; now is the day of salvation. 
We are putting no obstacle in anyone's way, so that our ministry may not be discredited. 
Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, 
in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in sleepless nights, in hunger, 
in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love, 
in the word of truth, in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left, 
through glory and dishonor, through bad report and good report; regarded as deceivers, and yet true; 
as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and yet not put to death; 
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing everything. 
O Corinthians, we have spoken freely to you; our hearts have been opened wide. 
You are not restricted by us, but by your own affections. 
Now in return—I am speaking as I would to my own children—open your hearts to us. 
Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness? What fellowship does light have with darkness? 
What harmony does Christ have with Belial? What portion does a believer have with an unbeliever? 
And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For you are the temple of the living God, just as God said, “I will dwell in them and walk among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
Therefore, come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you. 
I will be a father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty.”
