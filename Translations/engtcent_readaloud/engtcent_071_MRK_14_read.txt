Mark.
Chapter 14.
Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were two days away, and the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him. 
But they said, “Not during the feast, otherwise there will be a riot among the people.” 
Meanwhile Jesus was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the house of Simon the leper, and a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment made of pure nard. She broke the alabaster jar and poured out the ointment on his head. 
But some were expressing indignation to one another, saying, “For what purpose has this ointment been wasted? 
It could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and the money could have been given to the poor.” So they began scolding her. 
But Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why are you causing trouble for her? She has done a good deed to me. 
For you always have the poor with you, and you can do good to them whenever you wish, but you do not always have me. 
She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand to prepare me for burial. 
Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial to her.” 
Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to deliver Jesus up to them. 
When they heard why he had come, they were glad and promised to give him money. So he was looking for a way to betray Jesus at an opportune time. 
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed, Jesus' disciples said to him, “Where do yoʋ want us to go and make preparations for yoʋ to eat the Passover?” 
So he sent two of his disciples and said to them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him. 
Wherever he enters, tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher asks, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” ’ 
He will then show you a large upper room, furnished and prepared; make preparations for us there.” 
So his disciples left, went into the city, and found it just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover. 
When it was evening, Jesus came with the twelve. 
As they were reclining at the table and eating, Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, one of you who is eating with me will betray me.” 
So they began to be sorrowful and to say one after another, “Surely not I?” and, “Surely not I?” 
Jesus answered them, “It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread with me into the dish. 
The Son of Man indeed goes just as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.” 
As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed it, he broke it, gave it to them, and said, “Take and eat this bread; this is my body.” 
Then he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. 
He said to them, “This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many. 
Truly I say to you, I will certainly not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.” 
And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 
Then Jesus said to them, “All of you will fall away because of me this night. For it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’ 
However, after I have been raised up, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.” 
But Peter said to him, “Even if everyone else falls away, I will not.” 
Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to yoʋ that today, on this night, before a rooster crows twice, yoʋ will deny me three times.” 
But Peter said all the more vehemently, “Even if I must die with yoʋ, I will certainly not deny yoʋ.” And they all said the same thing. 
Then they went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, “Sit here while I go and pray.” 
He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly disturbed and distressed. 
He said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to the point of death; stay here and keep watch.” 
Going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. 
He said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible for yoʋ. Take this cup away from me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what yoʋ will.” 
Then he came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, “Simon, are yoʋ sleeping? Could yoʋ not keep watch for one hour? 
Keep watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” 
Once again he went away and prayed the same prayer. 
When he returned, he found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy, and they did not know what to say in response. 
Then he came a third time and said to them, “Sleep on now and take your rest! It is enough; the hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is delivered up into the hands of sinners. 
Rise, let us go! Behold, my betrayer has drawn near.” 
Immediately, as he was still speaking, Judas arrived, who was one of the twelve. With him was a large crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. 
Now his betrayer had given them a signal, saying, “Whomever I kiss, he is the one; arrest him and lead him away under guard.” 
When Judas came, he immediately went up to Jesus and said to him, “Rabbi! Rabbi!” And he kissed him. 
Then they took hold of Jesus and arrested him. 
But one of the bystanders drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. 
Then Jesus said to them, “Have you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as you would against a robber? 
I was with you daily, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But these things are happening so that the Scriptures may be fulfilled.” 
Then they all left him and fled. 
Now a certain young man was following Jesus, wearing nothing but a linen cloth. The young men tried to seize him, 
but he left the linen cloth behind and ran away from them naked. 
Then they led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes were assembled together with him. 
Peter had followed Jesus at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the officers, warming himself in the light of the fire. 
Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. 
For many were giving false testimony against him, but their testimonies did not agree. 
Then some stood up and gave false testimony against him, declaring, 
“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another that is not made with hands.’ ” 
Yet even then their testimony did not agree. 
Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Do yoʋ make no answer? What are these men testifying against yoʋ?” 
But he was silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, “Are yoʋ the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?” 
Jesus said, “I am. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.” 
Then the high priest tore his garments and said, “What further need do we have of witnesses? 
You have heard his blasphemy. What seems right to you?” And they all condemned him as deserving death. 
Then some began to spit on him, to blindfold him, and to beat him, saying to him, “Prophesy!” And the officers kept striking him with the palms of their hands. 
Now as Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the servant girls of the high priest came. 
When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, “Yoʋ also were with Jesus of Nazareth.” 
But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what yoʋ are talking about!” Then he went outside to the gateway, and a rooster crowed. 
When the servant girl saw him again, she began saying to those who were standing nearby, “This man is one of them.” 
But again he denied it. After a little while, those who were standing nearby said to Peter once again, “Truly yoʋ are one of them, for yoʋ also are a Galilean, and yoʋr accent is like theirs.” 
But he began to invoke curses and to swear: “I do not know this man of whom you speak.” 
Then a rooster crowed a second time, and Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: “Before a rooster crows twice, yoʋ will deny me three times.” And he broke down and wept.
