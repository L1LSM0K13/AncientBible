Revelation.
Chapter 15.
Then I saw another great and marvelous sign in heaven: seven angels with the seven final plagues, because with them the wrath of God is completed. 
I also saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had overcome the beast, his image, and the number of his name were standing by the sea of glass, holding harps from God. 
They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb: “Great and marvelous are yoʋr works, O Lord God, the Almighty! Righteous and true are yoʋr ways, O King of the nations! 
Who could not fear yoʋ, O Lord, and glorify yoʋr name? For yoʋ alone are holy. All the nations will come and worship before yoʋ, for yoʋr righteous acts have been revealed.” 
After this I looked, and the sanctuary of the tent of witness in heaven was opened, 
and out of the sanctuary came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were clothed in pure bright linen, with golden sashes wrapped around their chests. 
Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever. 
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
