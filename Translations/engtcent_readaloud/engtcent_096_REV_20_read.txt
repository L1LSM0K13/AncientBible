Revelation.
Chapter 20.
Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the abyss and a great chain. 
He seized the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world, and he bound him for a thousand years. 
He threw him into the abyss and locked and sealed it over him, so that he would no longer deceive the nations until the thousand years were completed. After that he must be released for a short time. 
Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received the mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for the thousand years. 
(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed.) This is the first resurrection. 
Blessed and holy are those who take part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with him for a thousand years. 
When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison 
and will go out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea. 
They marched up over the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down out of heaven from God and devoured them. 
And the devil, who had deceived them, was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. 
Then I saw a great white throne and one who sat upon it. The earth and the sky fled from his face, and no place was found for them. 
And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to their works. 
Then the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and each person was judged according to his works. 
Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. 
If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
