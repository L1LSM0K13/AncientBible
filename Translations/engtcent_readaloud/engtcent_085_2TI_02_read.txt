2 Timothy.
Chapter 2.
Yoʋ then, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 
Entrust what yoʋ have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses to faithful men who will be competent to teach others also. 
Endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 
No one serving as a soldier entangles himself in the affairs of civilian life, since he seeks to please the one who enlisted him. 
Similarly, an athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. 
The hardworking farmer ought to receive the first share of the crops. 
Think about what I am saying. May the Lord give yoʋ understanding in everything. 
Remember Jesus Christ, the offspring of David, who was raised from the dead according to my gospel. 
For this gospel I suffer to the point of being chained like a criminal, but the word of God is not chained. 
Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the chosen, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. 
This saying is trustworthy: If we died with him, we will also live with him; 
if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he will also deny us; 
if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful; he cannot deny himself. 
Remind the people of these things, solemnly charging them before the Lord not to quarrel about words, which does no good but only leads to the ruin of those who are listening. 
Be diligent to present yoʋrself to God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly teaches the word of truth. 
Avoid profane chatter, for those who engage in such talk will stray further and further into ungodliness, 
and their message will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 
who have strayed from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are undermining the faith of some. 
Nevertheless, the foundation of God stands firm, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord must depart from unrighteousness.” 
Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for honorable use and some for dishonorable use. 
Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master, and prepared for every good work. 
Flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faithfulness, love, and peace, along with those who call upon the Lord from a pure heart. 
Have nothing to do with foolish and ignorant controversies, knowing that they breed quarrels. 
A servant of the Lord ought not to quarrel, but to be kind to everyone, able to teach, and patient, 
instructing his opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth, 
and they will come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.
