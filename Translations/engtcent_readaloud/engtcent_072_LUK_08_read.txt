Luke.
Chapter 8.
Soon afterward Jesus was going through every city and village, preaching and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve were with him, 
as well as some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had gone out, 
Joanna the wife of Chuza (Herod's steward), Susanna, and many others. These women provided for Jesus and his disciples out of their own resources. 
As a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he spoke by way of a parable: 
“A sower went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some seed fell along the path and was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the sky devoured it. 
Other seed fell on the rock, and as it grew up, it withered away because it had no moisture. 
Other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it. 
But other seed fell into good soil, and when it grew, it produced a hundred times more than what was sown.” As he said this, he called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” 
Then his disciples asked him, “What does this parable mean?” 
He said, “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest I speak in parables, so that ‘they may see but not perceive, and hear but not understand.’ 
“Now this is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. 
The ones along the path are those who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and be saved. 
The ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy. Yet they have no root; they believe for a while, but in a time of testing they fall away. 
The seed that fell among the thorns are those who have heard, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares, riches, and pleasures of this life, and their fruit does not mature. 
But the seed in the good soil are those who hear the word, hold fast to it with an honest and good heart, and bear fruit with patient endurance. 
“No one lights a lamp and covers it with a container or puts it under a bed. Instead, it is put on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see its light. 
For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything hidden away that will not be made known and come to light. 
Therefore consider how you hear, for whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.” 
Then Jesus' mother and brothers came to him, but they were not able to reach him because of the crowd. 
So some people told him, “Yoʋr mother and yoʋr brothers are standing outside, wishing to see yoʋ.” 
But he answered them, “My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and obey it.” 
One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side of the lake.” So they set out, 
and as they were sailing along, he fell asleep. Then a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were in danger as the boat was being swamped by the waves. 
So they came to Jesus and woke him up, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” Then he rose and rebuked the wind and the raging water. They ceased, and all was calm. 
Then he said to his disciples, “Where is your faith?” But they were afraid and amazed, saying to one another, “Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?” 
Then they sailed to the region of the Gadarenes, which is across the lake from Galilee. 
When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a man from the city who had been possessed by demons for a long time. This man did not wear clothes or live in a house but among the tombs. 
When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, “What do yoʋ have to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg yoʋ, do not torment me.” 
For Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and he would be bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, but he would break the chains and be driven by the demon into desolate places. 
Jesus then asked him, “What is yoʋr name?” He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered him. 
And he begged Jesus not to command them to go away into the abyss. 
Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding there on the mountain. The demons begged Jesus to permit them to enter the pigs. So he gave them permission. 
Then the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. 
When those who had been feeding the pigs saw what happened, they ran off and reported it in the city and in the countryside. 
So the people came out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. 
Those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been delivered. 
Then the entire multitude from the surrounding region of the Gadarenes asked Jesus to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and left. 
Now the man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying, 
“Return to yoʋr house, and declare all that God has done for yoʋ.” So the man went away, proclaiming throughout the entire city all that Jesus had done for him. 
Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they had all been waiting for him. 
And behold, there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus' feet and begged him to come to his house, 
because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. As Jesus went on his way, the crowds were pressing in on him. 
Now there was a woman who had suffered from a flow of blood for twelve years, and even though she had spent her entire livelihood on physicians, she could not be healed by anyone. 
She came up behind Jesus and touched the fringe of his garment, and the flow of her blood stopped at once. 
Then Jesus said, “Who touched me?” When everyone denied it, Peter and those who were with him said, “Master, the crowds are surrounding yoʋ and pressing against yoʋ, and yet yoʋ say, ‘Who touched me?’ ” 
But Jesus said, “Someone touched me, for I know that power has gone out from me.” 
When the woman saw that she could not escape notice, she came trembling and fell down before him, and in the presence of all the people she told him the reason why she had touched him, and how she had been healed at once. 
Then Jesus said to her, “Take courage, daughter; yoʋr faith has healed yoʋ. Go in peace.” 
While he was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue's house and said to him, “Yoʋr daughter has died; do not trouble the teacher.” 
But when Jesus heard this, he said to him in response, “Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be healed.” 
When he came to the house, Jesus allowed no one to go in, except Peter, John, James, and the child's father and mother. 
Meanwhile, all the people were weeping and mourning for her, but Jesus said, “Do not weep; she is not dead but sleeping.” 
And they began laughing at him, knowing that she was dead. 
But Jesus put them all outside, took hold of the girl's hand, and called out, “Child, arise!” 
Her spirit returned, and she got up at once. Then he told them to give her something to eat. 
Her parents were amazed, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.
