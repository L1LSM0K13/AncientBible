2 Timothy.
Chapter 3.
But know this: Hard times will come in the last days. 
For people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemous, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, 
without natural affection, irreconcilable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, having no love for what is good, 
traitors, reckless, puffed up, and lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 
having a form of godliness but denying its power. Avoid such people. 
Among them are those who worm their way into houses and captivate vulnerable women who are overwhelmed with sins and swayed by various evil desires. 
Such women are always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth. They are corrupted in mind and have been proven unqualified with respect to the faith. 
But they will not make further progress, for their folly will become obvious to everyone, as was the folly of Jannes and Jambres. 
Yoʋ, however, have closely followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, and endurance. 
Yoʋ know how much persecution and suffering I endured in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. Yet the Lord rescued me from it all. 
Indeed, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 
But evil people and imposters will become worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 
But as for yoʋ, continue in what yoʋ have learned and firmly believed, knowing from whom yoʋ have learned it, 
and how from childhood yoʋ have known the sacred writings, which are able to give yoʋ wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 
All Scripture is inspired by God and beneficial for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, 
so that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.
