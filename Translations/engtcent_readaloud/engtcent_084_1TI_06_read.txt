1 Timothy.
Chapter 6.
All who are under the yoke of slavery must regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that no one will revile God's name or his doctrine. 
Slaves who have believing masters must not despise them, for they are brothers; rather they must serve them, because those who benefit from their good service are faithful and beloved. Teach and encourage these things. 
If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that is in accordance with godliness, 
he is puffed up and understands nothing. Moreover, he has an unhealthy desire for controversies and quarrels about words, from which come envy, strife, slanderous words, evil suspicions, 
and constant disagreement among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, supposing that godliness is a means of gain. Keep away from such people. 
But godliness with contentment is great gain. 
For we brought nothing into the world, and it is clear that we cannot bring anything out either, 
but if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. 
But those who wish to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many senseless and harmful desires that sink people into ruin and destruction. 
For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil, and in their eagerness to become rich some have wandered away from the faith, piercing themselves with many sorrows. 
But as for yoʋ, O man of God, flee from these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faithfulness, love, endurance, and gentleness. 
Fight the good fight of faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which yoʋ were called and concerning which yoʋ made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 
I charge yoʋ before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who made the good confession in his testimony before Pontius Pilate, 
that yoʋ keep the commandment unspotted and above reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
which God will reveal in his own time. He is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 
who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has ever seen or is able to see. To him be honor and eternal power. Amen. 
Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty or to put their hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. 
Command them to do good, to be rich in good works, and to be generous and willing to share, 
treasuring up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, so that they may take hold of eternal life. 
O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to yoʋ and avoid the profane chatter and counterarguments of what is falsely called “knowledge.” 
By professing it, some have strayed from the faith. Grace be with yoʋ. Amen.
