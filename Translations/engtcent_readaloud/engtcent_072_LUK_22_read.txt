Luke.
Chapter 22.
Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread was drawing near, which is called Passover, 
and the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to get rid of Jesus quietly, for they were afraid of the people. 
Then Satan entered into Judas, the one called Iscariot, who was numbered among the twelve. 
He went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might deliver Jesus up to them. 
They were glad and agreed to give him money. 
So he accepted the offer and began looking for an opportunity to deliver Jesus up to them in the absence of a crowd. 
Then came the day for the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. 
Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat it.” 
They said to him, “Where do yoʋ want us to prepare it?” 
He said to them, “Behold, when you enter the city, a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him into the house he enters 
and say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher asks yoʋ, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” ’ 
He will then show you a large upper room that is furnished; prepare it there.” 
So they went and found it just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover. 
When the hour came, Jesus reclined at the table, and the twelve apostles were with him. 
He said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. 
For I tell you that I will certainly not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” 
Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves. 
For I tell you, I will certainly not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.” 
Then he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” 
In the same way, he also took the cup after they had eaten supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. 
But behold, the hand of the one who is going to betray me is with mine on the table. 
The Son of Man indeed goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed.” 
Then they began to discuss with one another which one of them it could be who would do this. 
A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greater. 
So Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors. 
But it must not be so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader must become like one who serves. 
For who is greater? The one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. 
“You have stayed with me in my trials. 
And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as my Father bestowed one on me, 
so that you may eat and drink at my table. And you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” 
Then the Lord said, “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to have you, so that he might sift you like wheat. 
But I have prayed for yoʋ that yoʋr faith may not fail. Once yoʋ have turned back, strengthen yoʋr brothers.” 
Peter said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with yoʋ both to prison and to death.” 
Jesus said, “I tell yoʋ, Peter, a rooster will certainly not crow today before yoʋ have denied three times that yoʋ know me.” 
Then Jesus said to them, “When I sent you without a moneybag, knapsack, or sandals, did you lack anything?” They said, “Nothing.” 
Then he said to them, “But now he who has a moneybag must take it, and likewise a knapsack. And he who does not have a sword must sell his garment and buy one. 
For I tell you that this Scripture must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was numbered with the lawless.’ For what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.” 
So they said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.” He said to them, “That is enough!” 
Then Jesus went out and made his way to the Mount of Olives, as was his custom, and his disciples followed him. 
When he came to the place, he said to them, “Pray that you may not enter into temptation.” 
Then he withdrew from them about a stone's throw away and knelt down and prayed, 
“Father, if yoʋ are willing to take this cup away from me, do so; nevertheless, not my will, but yoʋrs be done.” 
Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. 
Being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground. 
When he rose from prayer and came to the disciples, he found them sleeping because of their sorrow. 
So he said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray, lest you enter into temptation.” 
While he was still speaking, behold, a crowd approached, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him, 
and Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?” 
When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?” 
Then one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. 
But Jesus responded, “No more of this!” And he touched the man's ear and healed him. 
Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple, and the elders who had come out against him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against a robber? 
I was with you daily in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour, when the power of darkness reigns.” 
Then they arrested him, led him away, and brought him to the house of the high priest, and Peter was following at a distance. 
Some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, and Peter sat down among them. 
When a servant girl saw him sitting in the light of the fire, she looked at him intently and said, “This man also was with him.” 
But Peter denied him, saying, “Woman, I do not know him.” 
After a little while, someone else saw him and said, “Yoʋ also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.” 
After about an hour had gone by, another man kept insisting, “Truly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.” 
But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what yoʋ are talking about!” And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. 
Then the Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter remembered what the Lord had said to him, “Before a rooster crows, yoʋ will deny me three times.” 
And Peter went out and wept bitterly. 
Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody began mocking him and beating him. 
They also blindfolded him and kept striking his face, saying to him, “Prophesy! Who is it that struck yoʋ?” 
And they said many other things against him, reviling him. 
When daybreak came, the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led Jesus up to their Sanhedrin and said, 
“If yoʋ are the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them, “If I tell you, you will surely not believe. 
And if I ask you a question, you will surely not answer me or release me. 
But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.” 
So they all said, “Are yoʋ then the Son of God?” He said to them, “You yourselves say that I am.” 
Then they said, “What further need do we have of testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth.”
