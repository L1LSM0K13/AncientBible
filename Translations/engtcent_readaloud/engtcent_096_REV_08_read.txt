Revelation.
Chapter 8.
When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. 
And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. 
Then another angel with a golden censer came and stood at the altar. He was given a large amount of incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne. 
And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended up to God from the hand of the angel. 
Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth, and there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake. 
Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them. 
The first angel sounded his trumpet, and hail and fire, mixed with blood, were hurled down to the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up. 
The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea became blood, 
a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. 
The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch. It fell upon a third of the rivers and upon the springs of water. 
The name of the star is Wormwood, and a third of the waters became bitter like wormwood, and many people died from the water, because it had been made bitter. 
The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night. 
Then I looked, and I heard an eagle saying with a loud voice as it flew directly overhead, “Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet from the three angels who are about to sound!”
