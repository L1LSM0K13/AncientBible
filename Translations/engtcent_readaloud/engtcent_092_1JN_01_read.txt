The First Letter of John.
Chapter 1.
We declare to you what was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the word of life. 
This life was revealed; we have seen it, and we testify and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and that was revealed to us. 
What we have seen and heard we declare to you, so that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. 
We are writing these things to you so that our joy may be full. 
This is the message that we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all. 
If we say that we have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth. 
But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin. 
If we say that we do not have sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 
If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
