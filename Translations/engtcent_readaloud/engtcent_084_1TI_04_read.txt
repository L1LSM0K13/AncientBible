1 Timothy.
Chapter 4.
Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will fall away from the faith and occupy themselves with deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons, 
being influenced by the hypocrisy of liars who are seared in their own consciences. 
They forbid marriage and demand abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. 
For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected when it is received with thanksgiving, 
since it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer. 
If yoʋ point these things out to the brothers, yoʋ will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, nourished by the words of the faith and the sound doctrine that yoʋ have closely followed. 
Have nothing to do with profane myths and old wives' tales. Rather train yoʋrself for godliness. 
For bodily training is beneficial to a certain extent, but godliness is beneficial in every way, since it holds promise for both the present life and the life to come. 
This saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance. 
For this is why we labor and suffer reproach, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe. 
Command and teach these things. 
Let no one despise yoʋ because yoʋ are young, but set an example for the believers in yoʋr speech, conduct, love, spirit, faith, and purity. 
Until I come, give attention to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, and to teaching. 
Do not neglect the gift that is in yoʋ, which was given to yoʋ through prophecy when the council of elders laid their hands on yoʋ. 
Attend to these things and immerse yourself in them, so that yoʋr progress may be evident to all. 
Watch yoʋr life and doctrine closely. Persevere in these things, for as yoʋ do this, yoʋ will save both yoʋrself and those who listen to yoʋ.
