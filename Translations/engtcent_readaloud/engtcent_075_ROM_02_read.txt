Romans.
Chapter 2.
Therefore yoʋ are without excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For on whatever grounds yoʋ judge another, yoʋ condemn yoʋrself, for yoʋ who judge do the same things. 
Now we know that the judgment of God against those who do such things is in accordance with truth. 
Do yoʋ suppose, O man—yoʋ who judge those who do such things and yet do them yoʋrself—that yoʋ will escape the judgment of God? 
Or do yoʋ despise the riches of his kindness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads yoʋ to repentance? 
But according to yoʋr stubbornness and yoʋr unrepentant heart, yoʋ are storing up wrath for yoʋrself on the day of wrath, revelation, and the righteous judgment of God, 
who will repay each person according to his works. 
To those who by patient endurance in good works seek glory, honor, and immortality, he will give eternal life; 
but for those who are self-seeking and obey unrighteousness instead of the truth, there will be anger and wrath. 
There will be tribulation and distress for everyone who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek; 
but there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. 
For there is no partiality with God. 
For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. 
For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified. 
For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what is required by the law, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. 
They show that what the law requires is written in their hearts, as their conscience bears witness with them and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even defend them 
on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secret thoughts of men through Jesus Christ. 
Behold, yoʋ call yoʋrself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God. 
Yoʋ know his will and approve what is excellent, because yoʋ are instructed from the law. 
And yoʋ have confidence that yoʋ yoʋrself are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in darkness, 
an instructor of the foolish, and a teacher of children, because yoʋ have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth. 
Yoʋ then who teach others, do yoʋ not teach yoʋrself? Yoʋ who preach against stealing, do yoʋ steal? 
Yoʋ who tell others not to commit adultery, do yoʋ commit adultery? Yoʋ who abhor idols, do yoʋ rob temples? 
Yoʋ who boast in the law, do yoʋ dishonor God by transgressing the law? 
As it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.” 
Circumcision does indeed benefit yoʋ if yoʋ observe the law, but if yoʋ transgress the law, yoʋr circumcision has become uncircumcision. 
If then an uncircumcised man keeps the ordinances of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? 
Then he who is physically uncircumcised and carries out the law will judge yoʋ who, despite having the letter of the law and circumcision, transgress the law. 
For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is circumcision something outward in the flesh; 
but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. Such a man's praise comes not from men but from God.
