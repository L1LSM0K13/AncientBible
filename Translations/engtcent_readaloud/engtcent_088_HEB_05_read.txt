Hebrews.
Chapter 5.
For every high priest taken from among the people is appointed to represent the people in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. 
He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness. 
That is why he is obligated to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people. 
No one takes this honor for himself, but receives it when he is called by God, just as Aaron was. 
In the same way, Christ did not glorify himself in becoming a high priest, but was appointed by the one who said to him, “Yoʋ are my Son; today I have begotten yoʋ.” 
And in another passage he says, “Yoʋ are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.” 
In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence. 
Even though he was the Son, he learned obedience from what he suffered. 
And having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him 
and was designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek. 
On this topic we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become sluggish in hearing. 
For though you ought to be teachers by this time, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food. 
Anyone who lives on milk is unacquainted with the teaching about righteousness, for he is an infant. 
But solid food is for the mature, whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish between good and evil.
