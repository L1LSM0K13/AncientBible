Who compelled thee to do so? Didst thou shrink or fly, and did any one drag thee on by force?\" But thou wilt hear nothing like this, for thou canst have nothing of this kind to condemn thyself for; and it is evident to all that thou wert in no degree ambitious of this dignity, for the accomplishment of the matter was due to the action of others.",
