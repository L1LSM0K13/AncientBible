These are his words: \"Is it,\" asks he, \"because the soul craves meat and drink, that we suppose material food passes into it?\" Then shortly afterwards he says: \"From this circumstance it is understood and proved, that the sustenance of meat and drink is not wanted for the soul, but for the body: for which clothing also, in addition to food, is provided in like manner; so that the supplying of food seems to be necessary to that nature, which is also fitted for wearing clothes\".",
