Why does he teach them to steal away from their Lord? Why to flee from their father? Why does he claim them for himself against the father's will? Why does he profess to be the father of strange children?\" To these questions he subjoins the following remark, as if by way of expressing his surprise: \"Venerable, indeed, is the god who desires to be the father of those sinners who are condemned by another (god), and of the needy, and, as themselves say, of the very offscourings (of men), and who is unable to capture and punish his messenger, who escaped from him!\" After this, as if addressing us who acknowledge that this world is not the work of a different and strange god, he continues in the following strain: \"If these are his works, how is it that God created evil?
