For thus, perhaps, it will not be unfitting to adapt the word of the prophet to our present blessings: \"In the multitude of the sorrows which I had in my heart, the comforts of God,\" by your kindness, \"have refreshed my soul,\" like sunbeams, cheering and warming our life nipped by frost.",

May this speedily come to pass, by the good help of God, Who giveth respite from pain to the fainting, and rest to the afflicted.",
